0,Architecture,First Year Seminar: Architecture Edition II,48026,3.0,"The first year seminar (part 2) introduces students to opportunities at Carnegie Mellon University and beyond. The goal of this course is to encourage students to pursue their interests inside and outside of the School of Architecture by introducing a range of opportunities, including study abroad experiences, internships, academic minors/additional majors, and graduate study. The introduction of the study abroad process and travel options will encourage students to consider a study away experience into their academic curriculum. Students will explore their additional academic interests by identifying their psychological preferences through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and matching these preferences with academic minors/additional majors at CMU. The presentation of the Intern Development Program (IDP) will engage students in considering future plans for earning IDP hours and understanding the process of securing an architectural internship. Students will be introduced to the process of developing an independent research project. Additional topical areas to be covered in the seminar will include an evaluation of the previous semester, scholarship/academic funding opportunities, graduate studies, and schedule planning for upcoming semesters."

2,Architecture,Architecture Design Studio: Foundation II,48105,15.0,"The 48-105 studio, called Foundation II, is the second studio in CMU?s professional B.Arch program. It builds on the lessons from 48-100 about clear architectural communication and abstract spatial-definition, but adds a greater emphasis on the material and experiential understanding of how architecture is made and used. We continue to emphasize architectural drawing and models (both analog and digital) as the primary means of architectural communication, but also as a method of creatively exploring and rigorously testing fundamental architectural ideas. We investigate, research, analyze, diagram, and apply lessons from local architecture, and great architecture of the past, in studio, and in the parallel survey of architectural history. We introduce the use of ?systems,? ?computational thinking,? and ?rules? in the design process to create order, deal with a range of parameters, and satisfy specific performance criteria. Beginning with more abstract formal design exercises, and ending with the design of a small building, we explore how tectonics, joinery, materials, as well as site, orientation, context, and human use can be harnessed to inspire great design. The design process is still carefully controlled, but students are encouraged to begin to speculate and take careful risks."
3,Architecture,Architecture Design Studio: Elaboration II,48205,18.0,"Building on the fall studio, the spring semester is concerned with more in-depth understanding and development of designs for small-scale buildings, now informed by greater knowledge related to materials, fabrication, and the act of construction. Following the New Materiality evident in architecture today, and acknowledging the importance of materials and assembly techniques for sustainable design, we seek to explore the aesthetic and experiential meaning of materials (WHY?), and the technical knowledge related to the use of materials and the processes of construction (HOW?). The creative opportunities and design implications of using varied materials, structural systems, fabrication and assembly techniques--both analogue and digital--are elaborated, especially as they determine the artistic, conceptual, poetic, creative, spatial, and experiential aspects of architecture. The studio projects, lectures, and the required building study will focus on the application and integration of knowledge acquired in a parallel Materials Assembly course 48-215."
4,Architecture,Historical Survey of World Architecture and Urbanism I,48240,9.0,"This course cuts a broad swath through time, geography and cultures, surveying critical episodes in the built environment of Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and the Americas from antiquity through the 19th century. Reflecting the inseparable relation between building and human needs, this course is not only a history of architecture, but also a history through architecture. It examines architectural and urban design as a form of cultural expression unique to its time and place. The design, use, meaning and legacy of a building is conditioned not only by the architects will or the patrons desire, but also by a web of technological, religious, social, cultural, economic, and political factors of the time. This foundation course is the first in the architectural history sequence, and introduces students to the subject and skills of world architectural history. It is a prerequisite for all subsequent architectural history courses. Student work will include several exams and a final."
5,Architecture,Modern Architecture,48241,9.0,"This survey of modern architectural history lecture course picks up where the historical survey 48-240 leaves off. It focuses attention on the 20th-century, and investigates the web of interwoven ideas and issues that characterize the modern age and ?modernism.? We begin with a look at the crisis of modernity that plagued most of western civilization in the late 19th-century, and then survey the major movements of the avant-garde and other responses to modernity, and end with what came to be known as ?Post-Modernism.? We will look more closely at the increasing divide between the ?disciplinary? edge of architecture, and architecture?s increasing ?professionalization? in the last century, focusing on how architecture has influenced culture through experimentation and provocative thinking, even when the primary intent was functional, technological, social, political, etc. Emphasis will be placed on the relationship of buildings to the more general cultural, intellectual, and historical circumstances in which they were created. Special attention will be devoted to the important manifestoes, theoretical, and critical writings that so determined the project of modern architecture."
6,Architecture,Architecture Design Studio: Integration II,48305,18.0,"The basis for the CMU studio course sequence is the expectation that the student retains and applies knowledge gained each semester to the current studio. The spring semester of the third year of architectural studies at Carnegie Mellon University is concerned with the detailed development and refinement of an architectural design as informed by the technical knowledge of structural systems, enclosure systems and the process of construction. The student is expected to articulate concepts and develop designs with more precision and in greater detail than done in previous studios and courses. In addition to criteria related to the development of design skills appropriate to ones sixth semester of the studio sequence, the following criteria are an explicit part of the evaluation of the student work"

8,Architecture,Detailing Architecture,48328,9.0,"This course looks toward the role of the architectural detail in the formation and thematic development of a work of architecture. Students interested in this course need to have willingness to explore and research building details, speculate on their appropriateness and document through analytical drawing their intent and assembly. The course will be composed of a weekly lecture and weekly discussion of research and drawing development made by each of the students."
9,Architecture,Architecture and Resistance: of empowerment and ecological thinking,48336,9.0,Course description forthcoming.
10,Architecture,Postwar Modern Architecture and Theory:,48350,9.0,"This architectural history lecture course surveys the modern buildings and architectural theory of the post-World War II period. It begins with the cataclysm of WWII and the fundamental shifts it caused on the conception of modernism, technology, cities, and geo-politics. It proceeds to investigate themes such as rebuilding and reconstruction, grand modern masters such as Mies, Kahn, and Le Corbusier, the fascination with technology, megastructures and utopian thought, the need for monumentality, meaning, and regional identity, and the dissemination of modernism from corporate America to the third world. It ends with the rupture in modernism associated with the social revolutions and the rise of a post-modern architecture in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The course includes lectures, readings, and discussions to define the unique character of the postwar period, as modernism both reigned supreme, and began to be questioned. Emphasis will be placed on the relationship of buildings to the more general cultural, intellectual, and historical circumstances in which they were created. Special attention will be devoted throughout the course to the important manifestoes, theoretical and critical writings that so determined the project of modern architecture. Work for the course involves extensive reading, preparing for class discussions, and a major research paper."
11,Architecture,Anatomy and Organic Form,48357,9.0,"This course arises out of a brief exchange I had with Tom Maynes, Morphosis Architects, during the QA following a lecture he presented at CMU during the spring semester 2010. During that lecture, he had declared drawing dead for architects-this despite the fact that the most compelling explanations he made during his talk were done with rather good gestural drawings. It had seemed to me that the work he showed lacked formal order, complexity, scale and proportion (goo would be a good word for my sense of it), and I have speculated ever since that a course in classical anatomy would be helpful in addressing those weaknesses in their idiom. Closer to home, I began to think it would be important for our students because they (as all students do) will tend to pursue the formal clichs of our time"

13,Architecture,"Rediscovering Antiquity: Travelers, Archeologists & Architects in Mediterranean",48368,9.0,"The course proposes a journey in the Mediterranean, with special focus on Greece and Turkey, but also travel through time. In fact ancient cities and archeological sites, from the hills of Troy to the archeological sites of Pergamon and Ephesus, to the cities of Athens and Costantinople/Istambul, will be studied not so much as signs of the important Greek and Roman past of the region, but as the object of late Eighteenth and Nineteenth century rediscovery. The rich vestiges of the mythical past of this region were then brought to the light, in the frame of complex and adventurous missions. The eyes of scholars, travelers and artists filtered and transformed the reality of the ancient objects and places, adding to their fascination and vitality and changing the way we perceive this legacy today. At the same time though, a new political agenda, new biases and new aims were connected with the rediscovery. These in turn influenced not only the way the past of the region was explored and the way the finds were studied and exposed, but also the cultural debate in the rest of Europe, with important effects on the architecture of the main European cities."
14,Architecture,TERRA COTTA ASSEMBLIES: Cultural Expression and Climate Change,48369,9.0,"This seminar speculates that merging communication with environmental performance, a material like terra cotta can be instrumental in returning cultural expression to the building skin (Picon 2013). The ornamental nature of architectural terra cotta facades can not only move us towards a more sustainable future, but also express our milieu"
15,Architecture,Techno-Pop Architecture: Systems of Technological Inclusion,48372,9.0,Course description is forthcoming.
16,Architecture,Real Estate Design and Development,48380,6.0,"This course will provide an overview of the real estate development process and explore the interdependence of real estate development and design. The course will introduce real estate development team members, processes, and phases, including feasibility, predevelopment, construction, and marketing. The course will include a substantial financial component that will introduce students to the basic techniques of property valuation, project budgeting, pro forma analysis, sourcing of financing, and investment analysis. Students will study how market demand, tenant requirements, site constraints, zoning restrictions, and available capital affect design solutions. Course work includes classroom learning, independent reading and exercises, guest lectures, and examination of case studies. The semester?s effort culminates in the execution of a team development project based on a current Pittsburgh development project. Teams will complete a basic market analysis, program evaluation, schematic design creation, project cost estimation, pro forma analysis, and evaluation of financial feasibility. Development practitioners will provide a critique of each team?s project to offer ?real world? guidance on student schematic designs and feasibility analysis prior to the final completion of the project."

20,Architecture,"American Regions & Regionalism: An Architectural History of Place, Time, and Cul",48440,9.0,"Despite the leveling forces of mass culture and globalization, the geographic and social diversity of the U.S. has created distinctive regional mosaics of landscape and architecture. Say New England and images of English Pilgrims, town greens with white framed churches, and industrial mill villages may come to mind. The Southwest conjures different images, perhaps of adobe pueblos, Spanish friars, arid ranches, and the color turquoise. The built environment of the Midwest, the California coast, the Mississippi Delta, and many places in between reflect particular regional identities that have been both unconsciously and consciously created over time. This course examines the historical development of regional patterns in the American built environment. It investigates how and why a regions architectural identity evolved in the ways that it did. To what degree is place something to respond to, to interact with, and to what degree is place something that is created? Our focus will be primarily pre-20th century when the forces of vernacular traditions were stronger, we will also examine more recent trends of regionalism as an aesthetic choice and a theoretical stance."
21,Architecture,History of Asian Architecture,48442,9.0,"The development of Indian, Chinese, Korean and Japanese urban space and architecture was guided by both originality and assimilation. This course is intended to serve as an introduction to the evolution of urban spaces and the function of the architecture within them. It is organized chronologically and will examine the impact of indigenous philosophical principles as well as Hindu, Buddhist and Confucian concepts on the organization of villages, capital cities, and religious centers. The course will begin in the Indus Valley. We will examine Indian Hindu and Buddhist cave monasteries as well as freestanding Hindu temples and identify the salient architectural forms that identify each type. We will then move to China where the earliest villages were arranged according to ideas about nature and the organizing system of fengshui. We will then move through urban organization and Buddhist temples in Korea to Japan where the Chinese model was adopted for early Japanese capitals. Chinese, Korean and Japanese religious centers will be studied as examples of both indigenous ideas and the adoption of Buddhist beliefs and temple organization. The examination of the Japanese warrior culture will include castles, new ideas in residential architecture, the Pleasure Quarters, and retirement villas. Contemporary architecture will be addressed through group projects that will examine specific structures from an Asian country of their choice. Each group will situate the modern buildings within the cultural and historic circumstances that led to their creation and propose ways that modern building design could be used in their own future work"
22,Architecture,The Depth of Surface,48470,9.0,"Lamination is the process of gluing wood together along the edge or face of a plank. There is unlimited variety in the ways to do this and to generate pattern in the process. This course will prescribe a few basic ways to laminate following standard rules of wood working and then introduce the possibilities of pattern generation. Generally lamination is unidirectional, however, in this class we will introduce ways to achieve cross directional patterning and the use of inlay to elaborate on the idea of patterning. Projects will be visual and sculptural statements. Their function will be limited and will not be furniture. Each exercise will present a series of basic wood working operations, which, when repeated and recombined will become products of compelling visual character. As visual idea statements you will be asked to experiment, invent and explore and take these standard operations in new directions. As visual idea statements the greatest clarity of vision will be achieved through careful construction."
23,Architecture,Pre-Thesis,48497,3.0,"The primary goal of this mini is to help students formulate a robust proposal for the 5th year Thesis, but it could be used to create a proposal for any grant, scholarship or academic research project. A series of weekly workshops, readings, discussions, and guest lectures will help students move from wide-open initial ideas about issues they are curious about and seek to explore, to the development of a rigorous research process that builds on existing knowledge and attempts to develop new ideas and advances the discipline. The class will explore the difference between design and research in architecture, how different research methods and modes of representation can be leveraged, and how concepts of disciplinarity and project can focus a topic. Students will begin to identify precedents, key readings and a research bibliography, an overview of the general topic they will research in depth, a detailed plan for a years worth of independent thesis work, and a well-defined end-product, likely a design proposal. An important task will be to identify advisors who can support, guide, and critique your work, who can act as intellectual collaborators as much as evaluators. This course (or an equivalent approved by the Thesis coordinator) is a pre-requisite for doing a year-long Thesis or semester-long Independent Project in 5th year studio."

40,Architecture,Shaping Daylight,48692,9.0,"Daylight is one of the critical aspects of valued architectural spaces, influencing ambiance, the overall atmosphere, and occupant perception, whether positively or negatively. Additionally, when it comes to buildings skin design, the control of radiation and exploitation of daylight is an effective way to reduce the need for electric lighting and improve the overall energy consumption of the building. The desire to bring natural light into spaces is not merely to support tasks; it is also essential to human comfort and wellbeing; thus, it becomes critical in design to not only shape daylight to provide a character to a space but also evaluate its performance. This seminar will introduce participants computer-based simulations to perform quantitative analyses of daylight as well as Immersive Virtual Reality tools to assess the qualitative aspects of daylight in architectural spaces. Formal instructions and hands-on exercises will prepare students to apply the concepts learnt to a design project of their choosing."

52,Architecture,Performance of Advanced Building Systems,48723,VAR,"Advanced Building Systems Integration This is a graduate level course that focuses on commercial building performance achieved through systems integration. In lectures, class discussion, and student projects, we will explore the topic of building performance, the design and technical strategies that support sustainable high performance; the design, construction and operation processes that are likely to produce sustainable high(er) performance buildings; and the current state of theory versus practice. The course assumes a basic understanding of buildings impact on the environment, of building design and materials performance, and the calculation of building heating and cooling loads. On that foundation, we will examine the concept of systems integration and how this approach can sustain the occupants and the environment far better than conventional design, construction and operation. Although US climate, building conventions and codes will be our reference point, we will broaden our discussion by using examples and data from many other countries. An essential aspect of our exploration will be identifying successful built projects and examining the factors that may have allowed those projects to succeed. If this course meets its objectives, students who successfully complete the material will understand and be able to discuss sustainable building performance characteristics, will understand the systems integration approach and how it differs from conventional approaches to building design, and will know how to positively affect architectural and engineering decisions to support the design, construction and operation of sustainable high performance buildings."

57,Architecture,Zero Energy Housing,48752,9.0,"Net zero energy construction has gone from concept to policy in just a few years, but built examples are still rare. What does it take, technically, to achieve net zero and what else, beyond technical requirements, advances or impedes a net zero future? 48-752 is a graduate level class that explores net zero energy design and construction in the residential sector. Through case studies and applied projects, we will explore what it takes to achieve quantitative net zero in residential buildings while maintaining occupant comfort and satisfaction. In locations where net zero is now required, we will examine the results of those requirements. At the outset, we will discuss specific definitions of a net-zero building and the implications of each definition. Through case studies, lectures, field trips, outside reading and assignments, we will examine how a net-zero building is achieved, including the use of renewable energy to achieve the net-zero balance. We will apply lessons learned from metered examples to real sites and to new design or renovation projects in Pittsburgh and will use simulation software to test and quantify the impact of our design/renovation strategies. We will also compare our strategies to requirements in US codes and rating systems such as IECC-2012 and LEED for Homes to evaluate their impact in moving the US residential sector toward much higher performance buildings. Although our focus is residential, many of the concepts and strategies we cover have parallels in the commercial sector. Students who enroll in the class must know how to calculate without software heat loss and heat gain for a small building. You are also expected to have a fundamental understanding of residential design and construction, plan reading and mechanical systems; US residential materials and construction methods for net zero will be covered in class."

84,Art,Critical Theory in Art IV,60206,9.0,"This seminar examines a period in contemporary art from the mid-1980s to the present in which artists and theorists questioned the differences between the politics of representation and, inversely, the representation of politics. Reeling from the AIDS crisis, the continuing and rising conflicts of post-colonial struggles, as well as the growing sense of a radical call for the recognition of, to borrow from Fred Moten, an undercommons-the dematerialization of the object of Art was suddenly not sufficient as the leading critical, aesthetic discourse. The notion of a critical After-ness, i.e. Post-Modern, Post-Medium, Post-Internet was the desire for a serious recognition of multiple social and aesthetics definitions at the level of institutions (both inside and outside contemporary art). Critiques of the Subject, of Cartesianism, of Whiteness, of Patriarchy, of Cis-Genderism, of Binarism abounded and works of art like Andres Serranos Piss Christ (1987) or Chris Ofilis The Holy Virgin Mary (1996) were emblematic of the attack many artists staged on intolerance that gave rise to national and international political debates about the role of Art in culture and civic life. We are still feeling the effects of these struggles - this seminar will attempt to make sense of this history, examining what has come to be termed the Culture Wars, of the late 1980s and early 1990s in which issues that had been so hard-fought for in the sixties, i.e. womens rights over their own bodies, protection of the environment, issues of racism (recognition of difference), freedom of speech, separation of Church and State were under threat again. Specific excursions will be made into theories of abjection, intersectionality, precarity, relational aesthetics, and performativity. New media technologies, and especially the centrality of Social Media and Information Cultures, will be a special focus of the final weeks of the course."

We will look specifically at artists whose use of the camera is embedded in a deeper discourse of sociality, politics, spirituality, conceptualism, abstraction, technology and literature as we traverse a range of photographic practices. The work of photography does not lie in the fraction of time delineated by the camera exposure but in the careful research, planning and attention to the parameters that come to frame a larger project. This course is for the dedicated, independent and hard working student who wants to work closely with the professor while developing a substantial project. Participation in this course grants students access to the course technology kit for the duration of the semester, including a professional DSLR camera with two lenses and a tripod.

112,Art,Advanced CP: Out There - Post-Studio Practice,60493,10.0,"Since the Dada movement began to erode the importance of institutional validation, artists have consciously chosen to operate outside of a studio context in a variety of ways. The eighties saw the emergence of movements and artist-run organizations intent on removing institutional barriers for art practice, enabling performance, civic engagement, social and political intervention, and myriad other approaches to feed the dialogues surrounding art and culture. This class will consider the philosophical, ideological, aesthetic, and political motivations, which influence such artists and organizations and will look at writers who have provided a corresponding critical framework. Students will engage in research and reading to develop their own project(s), using the class as a space for dialog and development, and the time outside of the class as the space for execution and manifestation."
113,Art,Advanced Studio:,60495,10.0,"This cross-disciplinary course explores an expansive definition of process. While this term has often been associated with material process (i.e. how something is made physically), we will work to extend its scope to consider artwork as a continuously present process inclusive of thought, research, action, contemplation, and states beyond and between. Though every object is the product of some process that occurred at least partially in the past, how can we undo this finality to experience the present tense of observation as inseparable from the process of making? While we know that art is most often an unchanging entity, fixed in material against time and entropy, making and looking at art offers qualities completely at odds with this"

276,CFA Interdisciplinary,Photographers and Photography Since World War II,62360,9.0,"Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles Teenie Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences."

285,CFA Interdisciplinary,"Urban Nature, Architecture and the Modern South Asian City",62725,9.0,"Urban Nature, Architecture and the Modern South Asian City Images of the so-called global-south city often present broken pipes, polluted water or tangled wires juxtaposed against an aspiring skyline, suggesting a lagging modernity where the provision of resources is halted while unrelenting urbanization races ahead. In this seminar, we critically interrogate this idea via a theoretically informed and historically grounded examination of the relationships between urban nature and architecture focusing on South Asia from the mid-19th century onwards. Drawing on concepts from architecture history, urban studies, and the social studies of science, we will discuss how urban nature is enrolled in the production of space, reconfiguring everyday life, cultural norms and spatial politics. Challenging understandings about non-western cities as exceptions within otherwise linear narratives of progress, we will draw from postcolonial critiques to understand them as crucial sites where the project of modernity is built rather than peripheral settings where it is (imperfectly or incompletely) deployed. South Asia, the sub-continent that includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, provides a rich set of historical opportunities to interrogate not just the technical but also cultural, social and political dimensions of urban nature. Through analytical reading, writing and dialogue, we will explore colonial ideologies of environmental improvement; the hygienic modernity of early 20th century planning; architectures role in agricultural and industrial development in the new nation states; tropical modernism of the post-war period; regionalist tropes of materiality and environment; and contemporary discourses around sustainability, ecological infrastructures and smart-cities."

570,Dietrich College Interdisciplinary,DC Grand Challenge First-Year Seminar: Thinking With Evidence,66118,9.0,"In a time of big data and widespread skepticism of science, it is crucial to understand how data and facts can be turned into conclusions, and then into public policy. Using topics from medicine, epidemiology, and public health, this course provides students an introduction into the grand challenge of understanding how evidence is used (and abused) in support of scientific conclusions. Questions of health and disease are particularly important areas for thinking about facts and figures because many life-or-death decisions have to be made on the basis of fragmentary and unreliable evidence. Every trip to the doctor, illness, and vaccination involves a complicated mix of public policy, scientific evidence, and emotional and historical factors. This course helps students understand the sciences and the humanities as united in their desire for rigorous argumentation rather than as competing or incompatible ways of thinking. Moreover, by taking a wide-angle lens to the topic, students will see how and why standards of scientific proof have changed over time, and track what these changes mean for thinking about evidence. Co-taught by a statistician and historian, this course draws on many different disciplines, providing students a broad introduction to reasoning across the humanities and social sciences. Students will be required to participate in written and oral arguments, read scientific articles as well as political, historical, and legal documents, and prepare a capstone project in which they will be asked to weigh real-life evidence and recommend a course of action to the Food and Drug Administration. Other topics may include vaccination controversies, regulation of carcinogens and toxic chemicals, mammography screening standards, and the treatment of infectious diseases in global health settings."

It could be that the billions of rocky planets and moons in the Milky Way are just inert and ready to be terraformed and colonized...but what happens when we encounter life, intelligent or otherwise? In Beyond Earth, co-taught by an astrostatistician and a linguist, students will consider the various rationales for engaging with the rest of the galaxy...and the potential consequences of doing so. Why should one consider leaving the Earth, and where would he or she go? Just to Mars, or to other planetary systems? How long would it take to get to these other systems? The distances involved in space travel are immense, and we cannot rely on warp drives. Inter-generational space travel is a possibility, but who is willing to leave Earth and spend the rest of his or her life on board a spaceship? When ones descendants finally arrive in a suitable planetary system, what happens if they find life? If so, what should they do - communicate with it, control it, or fly away from it? Perhaps these are the wrong questions...perhaps we need to ask if humans have the right to occupy other planets and moons in the first place. But even if we choose not to leave Earth, there will still be the issue of communication"

Immersive and spatial media constitute a suite of emerging technologies that offer the opportunity to expand arts, entertainment, science, design, commercial enterprises and countless other domains in ways that were previously limited to science fiction. The potential for augmented reality to disrupt our current technological ecosystem is tremendous. Many of these technologies are now 50 years old and just starting to enter the commercial realm. As immersive experiences and augmented realities become more integrated into our work and leisure, do we need to worry about the ways that unreality affect our experiences of reality, or our interactions with each other? How do we know that we can trust our senses to tell us what is real? How do we begin to grapple with the ethical, cultural, social, technological, and regulatory implications of this shift?"

But most problems arent so simple. Most of the problems we encounter require careful investigation and research so that we might propose solutions that connect with others to make change. In this 76101 class (one of two minis students can choose to fulfill their FYW requirement), we will learn how public problems are defined and argued across a range of texts, including proposals, op-ed genres, and white papers. By analyzing a range of proposal texts, we will identify the different kinds of legwork necessary to write a successful proposal, arguably one of the most challenging aspects of writing a persuasive recommendation for change. We will examine how writers unpack problems rhetorically and use evidence to argue solutions for different stakeholders who may not share common values. We will learn strategies for evaluating and synthesizing data from existing research to use in a proposal argument. By the end of the course, students will write their own proposal that recommends a solution and a feasible plan for solving a real problem."
996,English,Research Training: English,76198,9.0,"Big Historical Data The focus of this course will be a corpus of about 62 million words of authoritative historical writing, covering the Roman Empire to the present.

How do we attribute responsibility to specific individuals or institutions and dispute such claims, either by debunking them or shifting the blame? What makes the stories we tell and the arguments we make about responsibility succeed or fail? What unintended consequences can they produce? This course will examine these and related questions through the lens of legal cases in which individuals or institutions are accused of responsibility for harm, from vehicular accident cases to criminal trials. The study of these questions is not only valuable for understanding the legal process, participating in it, or writing about it, but the practice of attributing responsibility is common in many social and institutional contexts beyond law, even in daily conversation. It raises fundamental questions about culture, ethics, and politics evident in the way many legal cases capture public imagination and produce controversy beyond the courtroom.Drawing on readings from rhetoric, linguistics, and legal studies, as well as briefs, opening and closing arguments, direct and cross-examinations of witnesses, physical and documentary evidence, and judicial opinions from legal cases, we will examine the strategies advocates use to attribute responsibility and how the legal system manages such disputes. Students will produce written responses to readings, one short paper analyzing a claim of responsibility and one short paper advocating or disputing responsibility in a specific case, along with a final project that combines analysis with a recommended approach to advocacy. This course meets the Dietrich College Communicating Gen Ed requirement."

1004,English,Literature & Digital Culture,76252,9.0,"This course will study points of encounter between digital technologies and literature. With an eye on questions pertaining to the ontology of literature and literary meaning, we will survey the various digital tools and resources that have transformed practices of reading, writing, and critical response in the 21st century. At the same time, we will also explore the benefits of applying a humanities-based analysis to the digital age. Marshaling techniques from media studies, cultural studies, literary studies, and the digital humanities, we will address pressing questions about the increasingly prominent role of the digital in our daily lives. What threats does computerization pose to literary discourse? How can we leverage the tremendous potential of new technologies to promote creativity, inclusivity, and mutual understanding? What (and how) does literature mean in a digital age? To complement our collective investigation, students will complete small-stakes, entry-level assignments that introduce digital affordances for engaging with literary texts.

1008,English,Survey of Forms: Screenwriting,76269,9.0,"This is a course in screenplay narrative. The screenplay has a certain format observed by every screenwriter. Everything in it-- the title of the scene, the description, of the action, the dialogue -- has its designated place. Though there have been certain changes in formatting over the years, for instance scenes used to be numbered, writers used to include camera angles, the basic structure has not changed. It is not so difficult to learn the format. The difficulty is in developing a screen story populated by believable characters, creating an expressive and logical relationship between the scenes by manipulating screen space and screen time, knowing what to omit from the story and what to emphasize, and finally writing dialogue that sounds real, but that does not simply copy everyday speech. These are our goals for the semester."

By the end of the course, you will have a portfolio of polished work that you can use to narrate your professional strengths and interests. This course is designed for undergraduates pursuing majors and minors in a writing and communication field, and who want to explore professional and technical communication as a discipline and career area."
1011,English,Gender and Sexuality in Performance,76280,9.0,"Performance describes a wide range of practices, from the everyday to the artistic. Gender and sexuality are key elements in everyday, political, and artistic performances, from the very personalhow you order a latte at Tassa DOro, tell a lover goodbye at the airport or comfort a crying childto the very publicperforming a Bach cello suite or an iconic King Lear, staging a demonstration against police violence or marketing a new app. This course will bring performance and theory into a practical partnership to create and critique social and individual narratives. We will also take an intersectional approach to gender and sexuality, mindfully mapping these performances in relation to race, class, and ability. We raise questions such as, How does everyday performance define gender and sexual identity? How do gender and sexuality define everyday performance? How does aesthetic performanceart, theater, film, digital media, poetryintervene in the ways in which gender and sexuality are performed? Readings in theory at the intersection between gender studies, queer theory, intersectional feminism, and performance studies will help us explore these questions. We will also consider a variety of cultural and artistic practices. Since this class will be in a remote format, we will focus on performances that are digitally accessible, both for the performances that we study and those we create for the class. This course counts towards the Gender Studies Minor."
1012,English,Rhetoric & Storytelling,76284,9.0,"What are stories and why do we tell them? What purpose do they serve? What makes a story true? What effect do stories have on those who hear them? In this course, we will ask how narratives work rhetorically to shape how we perceive and encounter events, movements, places, and experiences. Students can expect to read and discuss narrative theories and practice employing these theories to analyze story artifacts, such as political speeches, newspaper or magazine articles, podcasts, and oral histories. During the semester, we will explore and analyze the way stories surrounding events like September 11 or movements like metoo or Black Lives Matter work (or dont) to influence and persuade. Students will consider the stories that infuse recent or local subjects of interest and investigate the effect such narratives have on contemporary contexts. Any student who is interested in developing a critical awareness of the ways storytelling influences and shapes our thinking as well as those who want to enhance their analytical toolkit will benefit from this course. Most remote class sessions will involve guided student discussions of narrative concepts and theories, individual and collaborative activities to analyze story artifacts, and opportunities to reflect. Weekly assignments will include concept notes, short analyses, and other in-class activities to practice course skills. The course will culminate in a final project portfolio where students will explore stories that shape a selected social or cultural theme, event, or movement. This course meets the Dietrich College Communicating Gen Ed requirement."
1013,English,Sex & Texts,76287,9.0,"Please see *Content Warning* Below In this course, we will consider how writing and communication serve as means to create, define, and bound our worlds, shaping our ideas about sex and sexuality at their intersections with gender, disability, race, geographic location, religion, age, and so on. Using a rhetorical perspective, we will interrogate how everyday experiences with and performances of sex and sexuality are tied to legal, medical, corporate, cultural, and historical practices and ideologies. Readings will consist of public, scholarly, and creative genres such as Roxane Gays Unruly Bodies, Judith Butlers Gender Trouble, Cardi Bs WAP (feat. Megan Thee Stallion), and the Hulu series Shrill and will address topics including but not limited to bathroom bills, rape culture, the beauty industry, intellectual property, citizenship, and marriage equality. Students in this course will 1) develop a vocabulary for talking about sex and sexuality; 2) examine how sex and sexuality are shaped by public, historical, and cultural norms; and 3) practice analyzing rhetorical elements such as purpose, genre, audience, context, form, and style. Student projects will include weekly discussion posts, two shorter papers, and one creative project. This course meets the Dietrich College Communicating Gen Ed requirement. *Content Warning* Because this course takes up questions of sex and sexuality, we will discuss the body/embodiment and issues related to violence (sexual, racial, intellectual, domestic, linguistic, etc.).

1020,English,Independent Study in Creative Writing,76303,3-18,"An Independent Study course is a course taken with faculty supervision that goes beyond the courses offered in a particular area of interest. It should not duplicate a course offered in the regular schedule of classes. A student wishing to take an independent study needs to locate a faculty member whose research interests are close to the area of proposed study and meet with the faculty member to discuss whether it is something the faculty member is interested in doing. The department requires that the student and instructor submit a written contract (available in the English Department) detailing the expectations (description of course of study, readings, how often the student/faculty member will meet) and requirements for the completed independent study project (number length of papers) and a time-line for completion of the work.

1024,English,Acting Out in the London Theatre,76311,9.0,"More Londoners went to the theater between 1660 and 1800 than read novels or newspapers. The theater was THE social media of this formative period in the history of an English-speaking, urban public, and this course explores the power of the theater as a means of both social control and political resistance. Instead of taking a traditional survey approach to this period in the English theater, we will study a succession of nights at the theater, specific performances of plays that happened on particularly eventful evenings when the playwhile significantwas not the only important performance. The farewell turn of a beloved actor, the presence in the house of a visiting African prince, violent protest by audiences against a play, an actoror pretty much anythingcould charge that evenings performance of a play with meaning beyond the script. We will approach plays from this period historically by reading, viewing, and listening to print and visual documents and music that inform the historical moment of the play. Most importantly, we will workshop scripts in class in order to learn from performance how these plays conveyed the power relations of race, class, and gender both then and today."

Its clear that fiction has changed since the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of postmodernism, but its not clear what exactly characterizes the work that has come since. In this course, we will read a selection of American fiction from the 1980s to the present and try to get a sense of its main lines. In particular well look at the turn to genre, the expansion to multicultural authors, and the return to realism. Also, we will consider how it relates to American society.

While these works represent the large stories of economic globalization, refugee migration, and ecological catastrophe, they are crafted around the small stories of love, longing, friendship and family.We will talk about both kinds of narratives, tracing the entanglements of one in the other.Students will reflect on the relationship between history, society and culture in a global context, situating the contemporary within the longer trajectories that mark the legacies of colonialism and imperialism. This course is virtual and almost entirely synchronous; barring unexpected situations, attendance is expected for what should be a lively class discussion."

1036,English,Fact Into Film: Translating History into Cinema,76367,9.0,"From the very beginning, film has provided a window into the past. But how useful are the images we see through that window? For every person who reads a work of history, thousands will see a film on the same subject. But who will learn more? Can written history and filmed history perform the same tasks? Should we expect them to do so? How are these two historical forms related? How can they complement each other? This course will draw examples from across the history of film in order to examine how the medium of film impacts our understanding of facts and events, the ways that film transfers those facts to the screen, and how that process affects the creation of historical discourse. Films may include such titles as The Fall of the Roman Empire, The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Saving Private Ryan, World Trade Center, Enemy at the Gates, Lagaan and Hero."
1037,English,Role Playing Game Writing Workshop,76368,12.0,"Role-playing games (RPGs) are a vibrant and viable popular medium for interactive storytelling. A generation of novelists, screenwriters, playwrights and TV writers came of age playing RPGs. They learned how to tell stories with their friends. Later on, they developed those skills and have won Pulitzers, Emmys, Tonys and Oscars. This workshop builds upon a thesis that interactive games share a large portion of dramatic theory DNA with plays, TV, and film. Play is performance. The skills developed when creating any time-bound media transfer well to games but must be seen through a different lens - the lens of the player. To do so, we first examine and dissect both RPG story and game design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both system as well as narrative best practices. Once we lay the groundwork, students are divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Teams use an existing pen-and-paper RPG system to create a set of a campaign-style story for that system and that story world. The final product is a hard copy story bible of portfolio-quality. I emphasized this is a writing course, not an RPG design course. Any level of writing experience is welcome, as I provide support and instruction to scaffold in experienced students. More advanced students often find the unique authorial POV of games to be a very different challenge. Experience with and passion for RPGs is a must in this class."

It should not duplicate a course offered in the regular schedule of classes. A student wishing to take an independent study needs to locate a faculty member whose research interests are close to the area of proposed study and meet with the faculty member to discuss whether it is something the faculty member is interested in doing. The department requires that the student and instructor submit a written contract (available in the English Department) detailing the expectations (description of course of study, readings, how often the student/faculty member will meet) and requirements for the completed independent study project (number length of papers) and a time-line for completion of the work. You should think of this as developing the equivalent of a detailed course syllabus/schedule, and typically involves development of a bibliography of readings."

In this course, we will build a methodological toolkit for computer-aided textual analysis. That toolkit will include methods for the collection data, its processing via off-the-shelf software and some simple code, as well as its analysis using a variety of statistical techniques. In doing so, the class offers students in the humanities the opportunity to put their expertise in qualitative analysis into conversation with more quantitative approaches, and those from more technically-oriented fields the opportunity to gain experience with the possibilities and pitfalls of working with language. The first part of the term will be devoted to introducing fundamental concepts and taking a birds eye view of their potential application in domains like academic writing, technical communication, and social media. From there, students will initiate projects of their own choosing and develop them over the course of the semester. The goal is to acquaint students with the strengths and limitations of computer-aided textual analysis and to provide them with the necessary foundational skills to design projects, to apply appropriate quantitative methods, and to report their results clearly and ethically to a variety of audiences. This class requires neither an advanced knowledge of statistics nor any previous coding experience, just a curiosity about language and the ways in which identifying patterns in language can help us solve problems and understand our world."
1042,English,Rhetorical Grammar,76389,9.0,"This course covers the anatomy of the single and multi-clause English written sentence and is useful for Masters students of professional writing (MAPWs) and English majors who wish to write with greater awareness and control of the English sentences they write and the awesome variety of sentences available to write. The course overviews the major grammatical forms and functions of the written English sentence. Students will learn to identify the major grammatical forms (Noun, Verb, Adjective), how these forms map on to grammatical functions (subject, verb, and direct object) and how forms and functions combine to create major constituents of the English sentence. Home-grown software, DiaGrammar, will allow students to diagram all the sentence varieties covered in the course. Students will leave this course with a systematic understanding of English sentence grammar as a resource for their continuing development as writers."
1043,English,Style,76390,9.0,"Some people think of style as individual panachea graceful facility with language that is as distinctive to a given writer as his or her fingerprint. According to this theory, style is a possessiona genetic talent that can be cultivated by one but never duplicated by another. Those who lack this innate stylistic flair often look for ways to compensate. Unable to achieve aesthetic beauty, they strive to be grammatically correctto follow the rules of writing. In this class, we will not treat style as an innate gift that writers possess and carry with them from situation to situation. Nor will we treat style as a set of rules that one can live by. Instead, we will think of style as a set of strategic choices that one considers and selects from depending on the writing context. Certain stylistic choices appropriate to one context may not be appropriate to another. We cannotand will notlook at all possible writing contexts in this class. Instead, we will focus our attention on professional writing contexts in which the goal (presumably) is to communicate clearly and coherently in texts composed of sentences and paragraphs."
1044,English,Science Writing,76395,9.0,"This course will teach students how to write clear, well-organized, compelling articles about science, technology and health topics for a general audience. Students will learn how to carry out research on scientific topics using primary and secondary sources, how to conduct interviews, and how to organize that information in a logical fashion for presentation.For writing majors, the course will increase their understanding of scientific research and how to describe it accurately and completely to a general audience. For science majors, this course will teach them how to craft fluid, powerful prose so that they can bring their disciplines to life. The course is not intended just for those who want to become science writers, but for anyone who may have the need to explain technical information to a general audience, whether it is an engineer describing a green building project at a public hearingor a computer programmer describing new software to a firms marketing staff. Scientists and educators today are increasingly concerned about the publics lack of understanding about scientific principles and practices, and this course is one step toward remedying that deficit.Students will get a chance to read several examples of high-quality science writing and interview researchers, but the primary emphasis will be on writing a series of articles, and rewriting them after theyve been edited. The articles will range from profiles of scientists to explanations of how something works. In particular, this years class will focus on how science and society interact, whether that means the way that science affects marginalized communities or how scientific findings are shaped by ethical debates. Students should expect to see their writing critiqued in class, in a process similar to what journalists routinely go through. The goal will be clarity and verve; the ethos will be mutual learning and enjoyment."
1045,English,Instructional Text Design,76397,9.0,"This course focuses on the planning, writing, and evaluating of instruction of various kinds, especially instructional texts. It is particularly appropriate for professional and technical writers, but also a good option for anyone interested in fields that involve substantial instruction, such as teaching or employee training. In the first part of the course, well examine the recent history of instructional design and the major current theories. Then well take a step back and study the concepts of learning upon which these theories are based, with particular attention to their implications for how instruction is structured. Youll find that different learners (e.g., children, older adults) and goals (e.g., learning concepts and principles, learning to apply principles to solve novel problems, learning a procedure, learning to change ones behavior, etc.) require different types of instruction. In the second part of the course, well look in detail at models of how people learn from texts and what features (e.g., advanced organizers, examples, metaphors, illustrations, multimedia) enhance learning under what circumstances. We will study and analyze particular types of texts. Some possible examples include an introduction to the concept of gravity; a tutorial for computer software; a self-paced unit in French; adult educational materials in health care; a workshop on sexual harassment in the workplace; or a unit to train someone how to moderate a discussion. We will also look at various methods (concept mapping, think-aloud, comprehension tests, etc.) that are used to plan and evaluate instructional text. You will do a project, either individually or in a small group (2-3), in which you design, write and evaluate instruction."
1046,English,Mediated Power and Propaganda,76415,9.0,"For most of us, the word propaganda triggers a familiar script. We tend to think of totalitarian regimes where the State controls information and prohibits the expression of dissenting views. We also tend to associate propaganda with certain rhetorical techniques - highly emotional words, deceptive representations, and glittering generalities that inhibit rational thought and manipulate public opinion. According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question"
1047,English,The Cognition of Reading and Writing: Introduction to a Social/Cognitive Process,76420,9.0,"Ever wondered how a reader is interpreting a text you wroteand how that compares to what you thought it said? Or how does your own process of writing that text compare to the problem-solving strategies experts draw upon? This course explores reading and writing as a social/cognitive processrevealing conscious and unconscious problem-solving strategies with which readers comprehend and interpret texts, and writers construct and communicate their meaning. To get at the why behind the surprising things readers do with a text, we will draw on the psychology of reading, where socially constructed memory networks, cognitive schemas, and meta-knowledge actively shape interpretation. To uncover readers interpretations, we put our knowledge to work trying out user-testing methods that help writers build effective audience-based presentations, applications, websites, or guides. We then take the same approach to writers as thinkers, examining the key problem-solving processes, from task representation, to planning, to revision, on which expert and novice writers often differ. Learning to track problem-solving through process tracing methods, will let you carry out two case studies of your own. The first will uncover the (sometimes radical) differences in how a small set of readers actually interpret a text you find significant. The second will be a case study of your own thinking process on a real task you are doing outside this class. Here you are likely to uncover old unconscious habits, problems you had to solve, as well as unrecognized successful strategies, giving you a new reflective insight into your own thinking as a writer. Freshmen prohibited from registering for this course. Sophomores must obtain instructor permission."
1048,English,Film Seminar: The Rise of the Art Film,76439,9.0,"The years between 1945 and 1970 saw an explosion of filmmaking talent around the world. Directors such as Vittorio De Sica (Italy), Jean-Luc Godard (France), Agnes Varda (France), Akira Kurosawa (Japan), Ingmar Bergman (Sweden) and Satyajit Ray (India) completely changed the way narratives looked on screen. Just as important, however, was the fact that American audiences used to the standards and storytelling strategies of the Hollywood studio system were suddenly presented with a variety of international cinemas which collectively came to be known as art films. This class will examine a broad cross section of such films while also scrutinizing the impact of the art film on Hollywood narrative strategies, domestic distribution networks, film criticism and American culture."
1049,English,"Law, Culture, and the Humanities",76450,9.0,"Im not a lawyer, but... How many times have you heard this disclaimer, closely followed by a lay analysis of law? This course, an introduction to the cultural study of law for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students, can be seen as an introduction to what goes into the making of such a statement. Where do we get our ideas about law? What do we mean when we say law? What counts as law? How does culture influence law, and law, culture? And to what degree should historical context condition any answers we might be tempted to give? Students in the course will study works in a range of genres (novels, plays, poems, judicial opinions, pamphlets) and develop methods for investigating ways that law and culture have been made by one another from the 16th-century to the present. Readings will include influential theoretical accounts of law (Aristotle, Hobbes, Cover, Habermas, Bordieu, MacKinnon, Alexander), canonical texts in Law and Literature (Shakespeares Measure for Measure, Melvilles Billy Budd, Kafkas The Trial) and some weird fiction by the novelist/legal theorist China Miville. As a counterpoint to the fiercely anti-historical law and economics movement, however, the course will put special emphasis on rooting intersections of law and culture in rich historical context, considering both local and international legal contexts (sometimes in fairly technical detail) alongside so-called ephemera of culture. Students will tackle the especially fruitful case of Renaissance Britain before developing final research projects, whether on the Renaissance or another period of their choosing."

1053,English,Crime Fiction and Film,76467,9.0,"This course will be concerned with hardboiled crime fiction in print and on screen. The hardboiled emerges in Ernest Hemingway a distinctive literary style, and about same becomes a formula for pulp crime fiction. The language and attitude of the hardboiled became associated with urban gangsters in films such as The Public Enemy. Newspaper crime coverage beginning in the 1920s becomes increasingly frank in both its language and photographic coverage of crime. These various elements will be the material for a new kind of literature represented Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, and especially Raymond Chandler, and for a cycle of films that owe much to their work, film noir. Chandler was responsible for invention of one of most enduring types in American fiction, the hardboiled detective. The course will focus on Chandler and the crime stories after him that make various uses of that type and the formula that has become associated with it. Throughout the course we will consider the social and political contexts in which these cultural forms developed, and what cultural work the hard-boiled performed. We will be especially interested such questions as the function of the misogyny typical of much of it, the different representations of race by white and black artists, the representation of police, whether the hardboiled is best understood as having a working-class affiliation, and the degree to which its various manifestations might be called realist.

Students will complete homework assignments and larger projects to reinforce principles and provide experience in all phases of the software documentation lifecycle. Readings and class discussion will bridge theory and practice."
1056,English,Feminist Rhetorics,76480,9.0,"This course traces advances made in feminist rhetorics in the past three decades, paying particular attention to the intersection feminist rhetorics have with race, class, religion, sexuality, nationality, and/or disability. While much of early scholarship on feminist rhetorics dedicated itself to recovering the voices of women in history, since then scholars have expanded their focus to consider how gender interacts with the concerns of protest, law, health, medicine, war, politics, technology, migration, and the list goes on. Throughout this course, we will consider how feminist rhetorical scholars have 1) critiqued the discipline of rhetoric; 2) developed new methods useful for analyzing gender in a variety of contexts; and 3) expanded the scenes of rhetorical study. Readings will include (but are not limited to) canonical investigations into early feminist rhetorics (Karlyn Kohrs Campbell, Cheryl Glenn, Jacqueline Jones Royster), influential theories on contemporary topics (Karma Chvez, Robin Jensen, Raka Shome), and popular accounts of feminism by current writers and activists (Beyonc, Roxane Gay, Malala Yousafzai). Students will conduct their own research on a topic related to feminist rhetoric that also aligns with their professional and academic goals. Graduate students interested in research will benefit from this courses focus on theory and methodology and gain an understanding of the scholarly trajectory of feminist rhetoric. Undergraduates students (both majors and non-majors) will have the opportunity to examine how gender intersects with communication and writing contexts in their everyday public and professional lives.

In this client-facing, project-oriented class, we aim to look at ways to tackle this problem, and design content for the web that is easy to access and digest. We will look at how websites manage and present organized information, with an eye to understanding what works well. We will use methods to learn who is using a website and why, and develop our toolset to test our decisions when implementing a new design. Along the way, we will develop a familiarity with the core web technologies of HTML5 and CSS3, with discussion of graphics, sound, social media, and other tools to enrich our presence on the World Wide Web.

In doing so, the class offers students in the humanities the opportunity to put their expertise in qualitative analysis into conversation with more quantitative approaches, and those from more technically-oriented fields the opportunity to gain experience with the possibilities and pitfalls of working with language. The first part of the term will be devoted to introducing fundamental concepts and taking a birds eye view of their potential application in domains like academic writing, technical communication, and social media. From there, students will initiate projects of their own choosing and develop them over the course of the semester. The goal is to acquaint students with the strengths and limitations of computer-aided textual analysis and to provide them with the necessary foundational skills to design projects, to apply appropriate quantitative methods, and to report their results clearly and ethically to a variety of audiences. This class requires neither an advanced knowledge of statistics nor any previous coding experience, just a curiosity about language and the ways in which identifying patterns in language can help us solve problems and understand our world."
1073,English,Style,76790,"9,12","Some people think of style as individual panachea graceful facility with language that is as distinctive to a given writer as his or her fingerprint. According to this theory, style is a possessiona genetic talent that can be cultivated by one but never duplicated by another. Those who lack this innate stylistic flair often look for ways to compensate. Unable to achieve aesthetic beauty, they strive to be grammatically correctto follow the rules of writing. In this class, we will not treat style as an innate gift that writers possess and carry with them from situation to situation. Nor will we treat style as a set of rules that one can live by. Instead, we will think of style as a set of strategic choices that one considers and selects from depending on the writing context. Certain stylistic choices appropriate to one context may not be appropriate to another. We cannotand will notlook at all possible writing contexts in this class. Instead, we will focus our attention on professional writing contexts in which the goal (presumably) is to communicate clearly and coherently in texts composed of sentences and paragraphs."
1074,English,Science Writing,76795,9-12,"This course will teach students how to write clear, well-organized, compelling articles about science, technology and health topics for a general audience. Students will learn how to carry out research on scientific topics using primary and secondary sources, how to conduct interviews, and how to organize that information in a logical fashion for presentation.For writing majors, the course will increase their understanding of scientific research and how to describe it accurately and completely to a general audience. For science majors, this course will teach them how to craft fluid, powerful prose so that they can bring their disciplines to life. The course is not intended just for those who want to become science writers, but for anyone who may have the need to explain technical information to a general audience, whether it is an engineer describing a green building project at a public hearingor a computer programmer describing new software to a firms marketing staff. Scientists and educators today are increasingly concerned about the publics lack of understanding about scientific principles and practices, and this course is one step toward remedying that deficit.Students will get a chance to read several examples of high-quality science writing and interview researchers, but the primary emphasis will be on writing a series of articles, and rewriting them after theyve been edited. The articles will range from profiles of scientists to explanations of how something works. In particular, this years class will focus on how science and society interact, whether that means the way that science affects marginalized communities or how scientific findings are shaped by ethical debates. Students should expect to see their writing critiqued in class, in a process similar to what journalists routinely go through. The goal will be clarity and verve; the ethos will be mutual learning and enjoyment."
1075,English,Instructional Text Design,76797,9.0,"This course focuses on the planning, writing, and evaluating of instruction of various kinds, especially instructional texts. It is particularly appropriate for professional and technical writers, but also a good option for anyone interested in fields that involve substantial instruction, such as teaching or employee training. In the first part of the course, well examine the recent history of instructional design and the major current theories. Then well take a step back and study the concepts of learning upon which these theories are based, with particular attention to their implications for how instruction is structured. Youll find that different learners (e.g., children, older adults) and goals (e.g., learning concepts and principles, learning to apply principles to solve novel problems, learning a complex skill, learning to change ones behavior, etc.) require different types of instruction. In the second part of the course, well look in detail at models of how people learn from texts and what features (e.g., advanced organizers, examples, metaphors, illustrations, multimedia) enhance learning under what circumstances. We will study and analyze particular types of texts. Some possible examples include an introduction to the concept of gravity; a tutorial for computer software; a self-paced unit in French; adult educational materials in health care; a workshop on sexual harassment in the workplace; or a unit to train someone how to moderate a discussion. We will also look at various methods (concept mapping, think-aloud, comprehension tests, etc.) that are used to plan and evaluate instructional text. You will do a project, either individually or in a small group (2-3), in which you design, write and evaluate instruction."

1079,English,Mediated Power and Propaganda,76815,12.0,"For most of us, the word propaganda triggers a familiar script. We tend to think of totalitarian regimes where the State controls information and prohibits the expression of dissenting views. We also tend to associate propaganda with certain rhetorical techniques - highly emotional words, deceptive representations, and glittering generalities that inhibit rational thought and manipulate public opinion. According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question"
1080,English,The Cognition of Reading and Writing: Introduction to a Social/Cognitive Process,76820,"9,12","Ever wondered how a reader is interpreting a text you wroteand how that compares to what you thought it said? Or how does your own process of writing that text compare to the problem-solving strategies experts draw upon? This course explores reading and writing as a social/cognitive processrevealing conscious and unconscious problem-solving strategies with which readers comprehend and interpret texts, and writers construct and communicate their meaning. To get at the why behind the surprising things readers do with a text, we will draw on the psychology of reading, where socially constructed memory networks, cognitive schemas, and meta-knowledge actively shape interpretation. To uncover readers interpretations, we put our knowledge to work trying out user-testing methods that help writers build effective audience-based presentations, applications, websites, or guides. We then take the same approach to writers as thinkers, examining the key problem-solving processes, from task representation, to planning, to revision, on which expert and novice writers often differ. Learning to track problem-solving through process tracing methods, will let you carry out two case studies of your own. The first will uncover the (sometimes radical) differences in how a small set of readers actually interpret a text you find significant. The second will be a case study of your own thinking process on a real task you are doing outside this class. Here you are likely to uncover old unconscious habits, problems you had to solve, as well as unrecognized successful strategies, giving you a new reflective insight into your own thinking as a writer."

1083,English,"Law, Culture, and the Humanities",76850,"9,12","Im not a lawyer, but... How many times have you heard this disclaimer, closely followed by a lay analysis of law? This course, an introduction to the cultural study of law for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students, can be seen as an introduction to what goes into the making of such a statement. Where do we get our ideas about law? What do we mean when we say law? What counts as law? How does culture influence law, and law, culture? And to what degree should historical context condition any answers we might be tempted to give? Students in the course will study works in a range of genres (novels, plays, poems, judicial opinions, pamphlets) and develop methods for investigating ways that law and culture have been made by one another from the 16th-century to the present. Readings will include influential theoretical accounts of law (Aristotle, Hobbes, Cover, Habermas, Bordieu, MacKinnon, Alexander), canonical texts in Law and Literature (Shakespeares Measure for Measure, Melvilles Billy Budd, Kafkas The Trial) and some weird fiction by the novelist/legal theorist China Miville. As a counterpoint to the fiercely anti-historical law and economics movement, however, the course will put special emphasis on rooting intersections of law and culture in rich historical context, considering both local and international legal contexts (sometimes in fairly technical detail) alongside so-called ephemera of culture. Students will tackle the especially fruitful case of Renaissance Britain before developing final research projects, whether on the Renaissance or another period of their choosing."
1084,English,Crime Fiction and Film,76867,12.0,"This course will be concerned with hardboiled crime fiction in print and on screen. The hardboiled emerges in Ernest Hemingway a distinctive literary style, and about same becomes a formula for pulp crime fiction. The language and attitude of the hardboiled became associated with urban gangsters in films such as The Public Enemy. Newspaper crime coverage beginning in the 1920s becomes increasingly frank in both its language and photographic coverage of crime. These various elements will be the material for a new kind of literature represented Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, and especially Raymond Chandler, and for a cycle of films that owe much to their work, film noir. Chandler was responsible for invention of one of most enduring types in American fiction, the hardboiled detective. The course will focus on Chandler and the crime stories after him that make various uses of that type and the formula that has become associated with it. Throughout the course we will consider the social and political contexts in which these cultural forms developed, and what cultural work the hard-boiled performed. We will be especially interested such questions as the function of the misogyny typical of much of it, the different representations of race by white and black artists, the representation of police, whether the hardboiled is best understood as having a working-class affiliation, and the degree to which its various manifestations might be called realist."
1085,English,Feminist Rhetorics,76880,"9,12","This course traces advances made in feminist rhetorics in the past three decades, paying particular attention to the intersection feminist rhetorics have with race, class, religion, sexuality, nationality, and/or disability. While much of early scholarship on feminist rhetorics dedicated itself to recovering the voices of women in history, since then scholars have expanded their focus to consider how gender interacts with the concerns of protest, law, health, medicine, war, politics, technology, migration, and the list goes on. Throughout this course, we will consider how feminist rhetorical scholars have 1) critiqued the discipline of rhetoric; 2) developed new methods useful for analyzing gender in a variety of contexts; and 3) expanded the scenes of rhetorical study. Readings will include (but are not limited to) canonical investigations into early feminist rhetorics (Karlyn Kohrs Campbell, Cheryl Glenn, Jacqueline Jones Royster), influential theories on contemporary topics (Karma Chvez, Robin Jensen, Raka Shome), and popular accounts of feminism by current writers and activists (Beyonc, Roxane Gay, Malala Yousafzai). Students will conduct their own research on a topic related to feminist rhetoric that also aligns with their professional and academic goals. Graduate students interested in research will benefit from this courses focus on theory and methodology and gain an understanding of the scholarly trajectory of feminist rhetoric. Undergraduates students (both majors and non-majors) will have the opportunity to examine how gender intersects with communication and writing contexts in their everyday public and professional lives."
1086,English,Web Design,76887,12.0,"The World Wide Web is a vast collection of information, far more than we can comfortably handle; even individual websites can pose so much information that they become overwhelming. In this client-facing, project-oriented class, we aim to look at ways to tackle this problem, and design content for the web that is easy to access and digest. We will look at how websites manage and present organized information, with an eye to understanding what works well. We will use methods to learn who is using a website and why, and develop our toolset to test our decisions when implementing a new design. Along the way, we will develop a familiarity with the core web technologies of HTML5 and CSS3, with discussion of graphics, sound, social media, and other tools to enrich our presence on the World Wide Web."

Students will work in teams to solve a larger and more complex communication planning and information design problem. Class discussions and critiquing are essential parts of this course. Adobe Creative Studio (InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator) will be used to complete the assignments."
1088,English,Introduction to Global & Postcolonial Studies,76893,6.0,"Since the 1978 publication of Edward Saids groundbreaking work Orientalism, postcolonial theory has gained currency as a critical discourse examining global experiences of colonization and decolonization. Since the term postcolonial was first invoked to describe the cultural effects of colonization, the field of study has expanded considerably. Today postcolonial studies looks backwards at earlier works on nationalism and cultural identity, gazes forwards towards seemingly dire futures, and unpacks present conjunctures. In this course, we will follow several threads of postcolonial theory to talk about the discursive operations of empire, the politics of representations, the problems of nationalism, the intersections of race, gender and sexuality in a global context, and the effects of colonialism, imperialism and globalization on economies, ecology, climate, and migration."
1089,English,Introduction to Media Studies,76899,6.0,"In this mini we will look at contemporary mass media from an aesthetic, ideological, and economic point of new.

It should not duplicate a course offered in the regular schedule of classes. A student wishing to take an independent study needs to locate a faculty member whose research interests are close to the area of proposed study and meet with the faculty member to discuss whether it is something the faculty member is interested in doing. The department requires that the student and instructor submit a written contract (available in the English Department) detailing the expectations (description of course of study, readings, how often the student/faculty member will meet) and requirements for the completed independent study project (number length of papers) and a time-line for completion of the work.

1099,Entertainment Technology Pittsburgh,Role Playing Games Writing Workshop,53371,12.0,"Role playing games (RPGs) are a vibrant and viable popular medium for interactive storytelling. A generation of novelists, screenwriters, playwrights and TV writers came of age playing RPGs. They learned how to tell stories with their friends. Later on they developed those skills and have won Pulitzers, Emmys, Tonys and Oscars. This workshop builds upon a thesis that interactive games share a large portion of dramatic theory DNA with plays, TV and film. Play is performance. The skills developed when creating any time-bound media transfer well to games but must be seen through a different lens - the lens of the player. To do so, we first examine and dissect both RPG story and game design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both system as well as narrative best practices. Once we lay the groundwork, students are divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Teams use an existing pen-and-paper RPG system to create a set of campaign-style story for that system and that story world. The final product is a hard copy story bible of portfolio-quality. I emphasized this is a writing course, not an RPG design course. Any level of writing experience is welcome, as I provide support and instruction to scaffold in experienced students. More advanced students often find the unique authorial POV of games to be a very different challenge. Experience with and passion for RPGs is a must in this class. To gain final admittance to the class you must submit an original two-page sample original dramatic scene (TV, Screenplay, Stage Play) to the instructor."

What can be done to make the experiences meaningful to the guest? These and other related concerns represent a challenging problem space for designers of motion based games of all types. In this class students will explore this space in small chunks. Working in interdisciplinary teams students will consult with experts and practitioners in dance, martial arts, sports, stunt performance, etc. Based on information and insights they gain from these people and observations students will construct models of small well defined parts of the dynamic motion systems they are studying.

1120,Entertainment Technology Pittsburgh,Role Playing Game Writing Workshop,53871,12.0,"Role playing games (RPGs) are a vibrant and viable popular medium for interactive storytelling. A generation of novelists, screenwriters, playwrights and TV writers came of age playing RPGs. They learned how to tell stories with their friends. Later on they developed those skills and have won Pulitzers, Emmys, Tonys and Oscars. This workshop builds upon a thesis that interactive games share a large portion of dramatic theory DNA with plays, TV and film. Play is performance. The skills developed when creating any time-bound media transfer well to games but must be seen through a different lens - the lens of the player. To do so, we first examine and dissect both RPG story and game design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both system as well as narrative best practices. Once we lay the groundwork, students are divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Teams use an existing pen-and-paper RPG system to create a set of campaign-style story for that system and that story world. The final product is a hard copy story bible of portfolio-quality. I emphasized this is a writing course, not an RPG design course. Any level of writing experience is welcome, as I provide support and instruction to scaffold in experienced students. More advanced students often find the unique authorial POV of games to be a very different challenge. Experience with and passion for RPGs is a must in this class. To gain final admittance to the class you must submit an original two-page sample original dramatic scene (TV, Screenplay, Stage Play) to the instructor."

1174,Heinz College Wide Courses,Applied Ethical Analysis,94883,6.0,"This introductory course provides a framework to increase accountability through ethical decision-making. The goal of this course is to allow you to understand the complexity and consequences of decisions, the utility of ethics in personal and professional life, and the motivations of others (be they ethical or not). You will gain the ability to recognize and address underlying principles in a variety of contextual dilemmas. Students will learn to practically apply established theory and methodology to create and sustain trustworthiness. Case studies, small group discussions, scholarly readings, and videos will demonstrate the relevance and importance of applied ethics."
1175,Heinz College Wide Courses,Advances in Robotic Process Automation,94886,6.0,"Todays new generation of sophisticated workforce robots act across business functions, integrate cloud and legacy applications, and are self-managing, scalable and fully dynamic. This course is an introduction into the fundamentals of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and how it is transforming the world by combining software robotics with the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). During the class we will dig into the technology, understand how advanced RPA delivers business value, identify processes ripe for this automation, and build an RPA business case. We will also discuss the talent implications of bringing bots to work and the impact on the organization and its workforce. Throughout the course we will be joined by business leaders who will share their experiences and leverage exercises designed to provide hands-on automation opportunities including use of a test environment. For the final project, students will have the opportunity to either build a business case for an automation candidate or create their own automation proof of concept."
1176,Heinz College Wide Courses,Applied Analytics:  ML Pipeline,94887,12.0,"Machine learning is a highly valued set of analytics techniques, a confluence of ideas from computer science, statistics, economics, physics, and others. Machine learning is transforming fields with new capabilities, ways of understanding and visualizing data, and is becoming a key driver in decision making. However, knowing when (and how) to apply appropriate machine learning techniques requires understanding of data, machine learning, and the problem domain. This class seeks to teach students how to address the entire machine learning pipeline, starting from messy data and provisional questions and ending with actionable interpretations and insights. The course will cover discovery, planning, analysis, and interpretation. Discovery involves understanding the data at hand, determining what is and is not answerable, and question generation. Planning involves contrasting the application of the desired machine learning method on ideal clean data with the messy data at hand. Dealing with representation, missing data, and designing appropriate machine learning machinery are all involved in planning. Analysis involves applying the machine learning method, checking model performance and assumptions in a principled and responsible manner. Interpretation involves the transformation of algorthm outputs into meaningful and actionable characterizations of the results. Each part of the pipeline is interconnected and students will learn to anticipate and address limitations through understanding of the pipeline as a whole. Throughout the course we will focus on one vertical, health care, recognizing that the methods developed will generalize to others. We will work with real, messy, structured and unstructed data--including databases, text, and images. We will contrast machine learning methods against what is currently used in health care analytics, and describe the advantages and promise of each."

1182,History,Introduction to Anthropology,79201,9.0,"Cultural anthropologists make the strange familiar and the familiar strange, attempting to understand the internal logic of cultures which might, at first glance, seem bizarre to us, while at the same time probing those aspects of our own society which might appear equally bizarre to outsiders. The goal of this course is to raise questions basic to the study of culture and social relationships in a multitude of contexts. We will also discuss the anthropologists relationship to the people s/he studies, and the responsibilities inherent in that relationship. The readings have been chosen to focus on topics that have long captured anthropologists attention and that continue to be intensely debated"
1183,History,"The Other Europes: The Habsburgs, Communism, & Central/Eastern Europe, 1740-1990",79203,9.0,"Organized as a combination of lectures and seminar discussions, this course explores the political, intellectual, social, and cultural changes occurring in 19th century and 20th century Central and Eastern Europe. It begins with an examination of the emergence of nationalist movements during the 19th century, to then explore the darker side of romantic nationalisms as they unfolded into the radical political ideologies such as socialism and fascism of the interwar period. We will ask to what extent these earlier histories continued to subtly influence post-1945 Central and Eastern Europe under socialism. The second part of the course will focus on the social and political transformations occurring at distinct moments in the history of the Soviet bloc"
1184,History,The American Railroad: Decline and Renaissance in the Age of Deregulation,79213,6.0,"Railroads in the USA are often considered as a subject for nostalgia or public sector failure, an image largely based on passenger service. However, the USAs private sector freight rail industry is considered a model for the world as the result of its renaissance following deregulation in 1980. This is a stealth industry whose history and economics are both intertwined and complex. Students will gain a basic understanding of the industrys history and economics and its role in the national transportation network, with special attention to the past half-century. In addition, students will participate in small group research projects in particular areas of special interest - for example, economic history, industry and safety culture, network economics, utility regulation or transportation policy."

A sampling of films we will analyze include"
1187,History,Development of American Culture,79240,9.0,"This is an introductory survey of American history from colonial times to the present. The course focuses on cultural history instead of the more traditional emphasis on presidents, wars, and memorizing facts or timelines. The major theme of the course is the changing meaning of freedom over three centuries. Required readings include several short books and historical documents. There is no textbook; background facts and events are covered in lectures to provide students with context needed to think about and understand Americas cultural history. Assignments will include three short essays and a final research project on a form of popular culture of the students choosing, developed over the course of the semester through three short blog posts."
1188,History,"The Year Everything Changed (1968): Protest, Politics, and Social Change",79254,9.0,"This course presents a global history of one of the twentieth centurys most tumultuous years. A period of tremendous political, social, intellectual, and cultural ferment, 1968 saw protests against authority rock the globe, unsettle governments, and upend social norms. Course materials will trace the origins and underlying conditions of this revolutionary moment as well as examine its still-relevant historical consequences.

1189,History,"Politics, Religion, and Conflict in 19th and 20th Century Ireland",79255,6.0,"This 6-unit mini course surveys Irish history from the earliest human settlements until the present day, with emphasis on the period since the late eighteenth century. Our main objective is to understand the sources of conflict in modern Ireland. In order to do that, however, we will look at a number of topics such as the role of religion in Irish society; the causes of population growth, movement, and decline; changing forms of protest; and the formation of rival myths of the Irish past and its meaning."
1190,History,"Sex, Guns, Rock, and Skinheads: Youth Rebellion in Europe, 1960-1990",79256,9.0,"Between 1960 and 1990, young Europeans rebelled against the conservatism of their parents and politicians. In 1968, they exploded into the streets in capitalist Paris and socialist Prague. In West Germany and Italy, a minority of left-wing radicals took up the gun to bring former Nazis and Fascists to justice. Young people demanded and practiced sexual liberation. Young women marched for their emancipation and led the struggle to legalize abortion. Young Europeans also contributed to the liberalization of anti-homosexual laws. The British Beat revolution rocked the world with its innovative music, anti-establishment lyrics, shocking fashions, and wild lifestyles. By the 1980s, youth rebellion had taken on disturbing trends with the emergence of right-wing Skinheads and a surge in drug addiction. The course combines lecture and discussion of readings and films. Students will write three essays (1000 words each) based on class assignments. They will write a final essay (1500-1700 words) based on their own research into the press, fanzines, films, etc. (in place of a final exam)."

1192,History,Napoleon,79258,6.0,"It is said that more books have been written on Napoleon Bonaparte than on almost any other historical figure. In this course, we will explore several themes, including how a revolution dedicated to liberty, equality, and fraternity culminated in the rise of a leader who exercised an authoritarian and personal power. What weaknesses was Napoleon able to exploit in Frances fledgling democracy, and how did he build a personal brand that allowed him to accumulate power around himself? We will examine his transformation of Europe, but also his actions beyond Europe in Egypt and Haiti. Finally, we will interrogate the notion of great men of history, highlighting some of the voices that a focus on Napoleon himself fails to capture."
1193,History,Modern China: From the Birth of Mao ... to Now,79262,9.0,"This course is an introduction to major themes in twentieth-century Chinese history, including the transition from empire to nation, revolution, social change and modernization, western and Japanese imperialism, the rise of the party-state, Chinese socialism, economic liberalization and the so-called Chinese Dream. The first half of the class is devoted to the period between the fall of the imperial system and the founding of the Peoples Republic of China (1911-1949). If the victory of the Chinese Communist Party and development of the socialist state are to be considered in historical context, it is necessary to first understand the political, cultural, economic and intellectual currents that immediately preceded them. During the second half of the course, we will examine the Maoist period (1949-1976). We will investigate the Chinese Communist Party as both a state-building institution and an engine of social transformation, and consider the tensions these dual roles produced. Finally, we will look at the Reform Period (1978-present), and reflect on a newly robust Chinas attempts to come to terms with its own recent past and what the consequences might be for both China and the world."
1194,History,Tibet and China: History and Propaganda,79264,6.0,"This course is an introduction to the Tibet Question, the dispute over whether Tibet should be part of China, an independent nation-state, or, as the current Dalai Lama now advocates, something in between. History often serves as the battleground on which competing visions of the nation are fought - who should be included and excluded, where natural boundaries begin and end. This almost always requires a process of simplification in which inconvenient details are forgotten or repurposed in the service of national agendas. The Tibet Question is a telling example. In this class, we investigate the historical relationship between China and Tibet from the 13th century through the present, and note the ways advocates on both sides of the Tibet Question have constructed historical narratives (propaganda) in support of their political positions. We will also discuss the prospects for a political solution and consider the lessons the Tibet Question may hold for understanding other outstanding historical disputes."
1195,History,Russian History: Game of Thrones,79265,9.0,"How are states built? How are empires forged? This course, beginning with the first settlements of tribal nomads in the ninth century and ending with the abolition of serfdom in 1861, surveys the grand game of thrones in Russian history. It explores the building of a Russian Empire from the first princely kingdoms at murderous war with each other to the emergence of a strong state, headed by a tsar and centered in Moscow. Over the centuries, we make the acquaintance of Mongol marauders, greedy princes, and brave peasant rebels, as well as Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, and the long succession of reformers and reactionaries who occupied the Russian throne."
1196,History,"Coexistence and Conflict: Muslims, Christians and Jews in Spain and Portugal",79272,9.0,"In Medieval Spain and Portugal, Islam, Judaism and Christianity coexisted in a situation distinguished by cooperation and exchange, as well as by friction, rivalry and violence.

We shall discuss topics such as"
1197,History,Introduction to Global Studies,79275,9.0,"We live in an increasingly interconnected world, one in which our everyday actions have repercussions across vast distances. To understand this ever-denser web of connections, we must think beyond simplistic accounts of globalization as a uniformly positive, negative, or homogenizing process. Economic crisis, impoverishment, rising inequality, environmental degradation, pandemic disease, and irredentist movements are just as much a part of the story as are technological innovation, digital communication, global supply chains, cultural exchange, the promotion of human rights, and the rise of cosmopolitan values. This course aims to equip you with a conceptual toolkit for thinking critically and holistically about the many dimensions of globalization. By examining how globalization connects and shapes the everyday lives of people around the world, including our own, we will establish a foundation both for your advanced coursework in Global Studies and for your lifelong education as a globally aware professional and citizen."
1198,History,How (Not) to Change the World,79278,9.0,"Its often said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. What, then, can we learn by excavating some of those pavers and interrogating the theories of change that underlie them? And what can we learn from more successful attempts to enact social change? In this course, we will use the tools of history, anthropology, and critical theory to examine various efforts to change the world. From top-down social engineering to neoliberal market citizenship to grassroots organizing, case studies will challenge us to detect theories of change (even when they are concealed) and evaluate their consequences (intended and otherwise). With those lessons in mind, we will then apply our tools to the theories of change that we enact, often unwittingly, as members of a university. Which roads are we paving and where do they lead?"
1199,History,Introduction to Religion,79281,9.0,"Religion can be understood from the outside, through the academic lenses of history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, etc., and from the inside, listening to the experiences and reflections of those who practice various faiths. The course will examine major religious traditions from several perspectives, and begin to explore such topics as the relationship between religion and science, faith and reason, and religion in public life. This introduction is designed for students with a general interest in religion, as well as those contemplating a Religious Studies minor."
1200,History,"Bananas, Baseball, and Borders: Latin America and the United States",79288,9.0,"This course will use historical documents, film/video, and popular music to examine the tumultuous and paradoxical relationship between Latin America and the United States from the time of independence to the present, with an emphasis on Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean during the Cold War (1945-1989) and its aftermath (1990s-present). We will literally talk about bananas, baseball and borders; the title also alludes to the key dimensions of the relationship we will study"
1201,History,Inward Odyssey,79293,9.0,"This course is ONLY offered at Carnegie Mellon in Qatar. Inward Odyssey will explore world history by examining it through the outward-looking eyes of travel writers, on the assumption that travelogues, though supposedly written about the other, in fact provide crucial insights about the mindset of the culture that produced them, and often serve as a vehicle for cultural self-exploration or even self-criticism. In terms of content, this course is intended to overlap with World History, Islam and the European World, and US-Arab Encounters. However, this course is intended to be a skills course, designed not to teach students about specific historical periods, but rather to give students the tools they need to conduct their own critical explorations into the historical past."
1202,History,Technology and Work,79297,9.0,"In recent years, conversations about the relationship between technology and work seem to have been conducted with particular fervor"
1203,History,Fact into Film: Translating History into Cinema,79306,9.0,"From the very beginning, film has provided a window into the past. But how useful are the images we see through that window? For every person who reads a work of history, thousands will see a film on the same subject. But who will learn more? Can written history and filmed history perform the same tasks? Should we expect them to do so? How are these two historical forms related? How can they complement each other? This course will draw examples from across the history of film in order to examine how the medium of film impacts our understanding of facts and events, the ways that film transfers those facts to the screen, and how that process affects the creation of historical discourse. Films may include such titles as The Fall of the Roman Empire, The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Saving Private Ryan, World Trade Center, Enemy at the Gates, Lagaan and Hero."
1204,History,"Women, Politics, and Protest",79320,9.0,"This course examines the history of womens rights agitation in the United States from the early nineteenth-century to the present. It investigates both well-known struggles for womens equality--including the battles for womens voting rights, an Equal Rights Amendment, and access to birth control--and also explores the history of lesser-known struggles for economic and racial justice. Because women often differed about what the most important issues facing their sex were, this course explores not only the issues that have united women, but also those that have divided themkeeping intersectionality and womens diversity at the center of the course."
1205,History,U.S. Gay and Lesbian History,79325,6.0,"US Gay and Lesbian History offers an overview of the changing context and circumstances of sexual minorities in American culture. From early constructions of moral opprobrium, criminal deviance or medical pathology, the LGBT community emerged in the twentieth and twenty-first century as a political constituency and a vital part of contemporary society. Students should be aware that this course will necessarily address issues of intimate relations and sexuality as well as broader historical issues."
1206,History,Photographers and Photography Since World War II,79328,9.0,"Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles Teenie Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences. As available, students will be expected to make one or more visits to photography exhibitions on view in Pittsburgh (locations to be announced at the first class.)"
1207,History,Body Politics: Women and Health in America,79331,9.0,[Note
1208,History,Roots of Rock & Roll,79345,9.0,"This course is about open source, collaborative innovation and the impact of social and technological change on American music. We will spend the first 7 weeks on early remix music (slave songs, Anglo-Appalachian ballads, ragtime, and Depression era blues and country). After studying Bessie Smith, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Hank Williams, and other early artists, well spend the last 7 weeks on revolutionaries like Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin. The format is informal lecture and discussion. Assignments include reading two books plus some articles, weekly music listening, short papers, and a final project. NB"
1209,History,United States and the Holocaust,79349,6.0,"This course will explore challenging historical material related to Hitler, the Nazis and Americas response. Issues relating to immigration, refugee status, contrasting styles of political leadership, foreign policy goals, news coverage, anti-Semitism, theories of racial supremacy, decision making, global responsibilities will be considered both in the perspective of then and now as we look both at America and at Europe. This course will prompt you to think not only about the events then, but also about the implications for us today as individuals and as citizens of the world. A film, a meeting with a survivor or child of survivor as well as the inclusion of first hand readings will serve to strengthen the learning impact."
1210,History,Early Christianity,79350,9.0,"This course examines the origins of Christianity in historical perspective. Using both Christian and non-Christian sources from the period, we will examine how and why Christianity assumed the form that it did by analyzing its background in the Jewish community of Palestine, its place in the classical world, and its relationship to other religious and philosophical traditions of the time. We will also examine historically how the earliest Christians understood the life and message of Jesus, the debates about belief and practice that arose among them, and the factors influencing the extraordinary spread of the movement in its earliest centuries. This course satisfies one of the elective requirements for the Religious Studies minor."
1211,History,"'Lock 'em Up': The Imprisonment of Children and Youth, 1820s-2021",79353,6.0,"Can young lawbreakers be rehabilitated, or should they be removed from society to prevent them endangering others? Since the 1820s, reformers, philanthropists, and state officials in the Western world have wrestled with the question of how to reduce juvenile crime and turn delinquents into good citizens. The institutions and policies they created reflected their conceptions of young criminals, their backgrounds and families, their gender and their race. How did experts develop a body of knowledge about at-risk youth, what practices did they put into place, and what spaces did they build to house and contain the children? How have the children themselves responded, developing a sense of their own identity through compliance with or resistance to reformers intent? In this course, we will explore ideas, practices, and institutions created to save juvenile delinquents, presented in reports and studies as well as fiction and film. Students will read and view a variety of primary and secondary sources from North America and Europe from the early nineteenth to the late twentieth centuries. Assessment will include participation in class discussion, written assignments, and exams."
1212,History,Science and the Body,79357,6.0,"The human body has been always an object of fascination. Across time and space, people have wondered what lurks beneath the skin, why we get sick or remain well, and how to explain human variation. The methods used to investigate these questions have, however, varied widely. In this course, we will explore that diversity - from the dissection of medieval corpses to 19th century phrenology to contemporary biohacking - examining how different communities have sought to study, control, and change their bodies over the past several hundred years. In doing so, we will focus on how these scientific efforts were shaped by the political, cultural, and economic values of their times. We will also pay attention to the profound and often ongoing effects of these experiments, particularly on the people who served - both willingly and unwillingly - as their human subjects."
1213,History,The Rise and Fall of Pittsburgh Steel,79372,6.0,"For over 150 years, the Pittsburgh region was world-renowned for the scale and intensity of its iron and steel manufacturing complex. This mini course will trace the origins, explosive growth, stagnation and ultimate collapse of this remarkable industrial complex. Students will gain an understanding of Pittsburghs rich industrial history - what makes it The Steel City, understand the emergence and evolution of iron and steel making technology, appreciate the impact of Pittsburghs iron and steel industrialization on living and working conditions for workers, and analyze the factors that drove the emergence of Pittsburgh steel then to its decline and collapse. The course is structured loosely around a set of periods in Pittsburghs history through which key themes are drawn."
1214,History,"Inequality, Social Justice, and the Black Urban Experience: 1930s to 2010s",79374,9.0,"Since the 2016 Presidential Election, politicians, journalists, and academics have looked upon the white working class as the key to understanding the historic boom and bust cycles of American capitalism. Whats left out of this discussion is a crucial component to the American political economy-black workers. African-Americans contribution to the economy spans four hundred years, from the initial settlement of the American continent down through the present day. Throughout this period, black Americans found the courage and creativity to construct their own complex body of political ideas about the contradictory nature between democracy and capitalism. In effect, black Americans made their own history. The legacy of black workers also teaches us that the understanding of race is intimately intertwined with the understanding of class. Throughout this course, we will talk about a wide spectrum of African-American leaders, intellectuals, organizations and institutions spanning from the Great Depression to the todays post-industrial era. This course is, thus, constructed around the voices and languages used by black people themselves. The key issues to be discussed are the rise of organized labor, urbanization and segregation, and law enforcement."
1215,History,"Food, Culture, and Power: A History of Eating",79377,9.0,"How can human societies ensure that 8 billion people have enough good food to eat without exploiting people or the planet? This course will start with the assumption that the answer to that question requires not only technological innovations, but also an understanding of the cultural and political dimensions of food. For the first half of the course, we will explore the history of human eating, starting in deep time and then moving toward the present, considering along the way the historical evolution of food production and consumption, paying attention to both cultural diversity and cultural exchanges of foods and cuisine. Students will pursue individual research projects focused on a topic of their choose related to major course themes during the second half of the semester. Evaluation based on in-class participation, analytical reflections on weekly readings, and the research paper."
1216,History,Extreme Ethnography,79379,9.0,"Observation, participation and direct experience of the field are hallmarks of anthropological ways of knowing, and their representation has played a foundational role in ethnographic writing both past and present. Yet reflexive and postmodernist explorations of these topics have triggered contentious debates over the nature of anthropology as a scientific or humanistic enterprise, and over its ethical, political and epistemological value. In this seminar, we will approach such questions through an exploration of the extremes of ethnographic fieldwork and writing. We will consider such topics as"
1217,History,Capitalism: A Global History,79383,6.0,"What is capitalism? How does it differ from the systems that preceded it, and how did it come to revolutionize the globe? This course examines the development of capitalism from the 16th century to the present. We will read Karl Marx and Adam Smith, who both attempted to theorize the new, emerging system. We will survey the transition from feudalism to capitalism, the role of slavery in capitalist development, and changes in womens power and household production. We will examine the development and demise of the factory system and deindustrialization in Americas rust belt cities as well as globalization, the latest dynamic phase of capitalism. Finally, we will discuss the impact of technology, casual labor, low wages, and unemployment on democracy, the prison system, and the rise of a new technocratic elite."
1218,History,A Tale of Two Epidemics: Influenza 1918 and Covid 19,79386,9.0,"This course will compare the experiences of Americans during its two deadliest pandemics, the Influenza 1918 epidemic and the Covid-19 epidemic. Each week we will compare a facet of the two epidemics, such as government responses, medical knowledge, public health measures, African American experiences, global dimensions, and more. Students will do guided original research comparing a facet of the two epidemics, and the class will self-publish a collection of student essays as a book."
1219,History,"Race, Gender, and the Politics of Sports in America since 1900",79388,6.0,"The course will survey the history of sports in the United States, focusing primarily on the 20th century. Topics considered will include sports and race, gender, and politics; the commercialization of sport; and collegiate sports. We will pay particular attention to the way in which sports have served as an arena for dissent. Also covered will be Pittsburghs relation to national sports trends. By the end of the semester students will gain an understanding of the changing role of sports in the United States."
1220,History,History of Computing and Computer Science: Perspectives on the Digital Age,79390,6.0,"How did the computer come to be, and why did the practice of computer science develop historically the way it did? This course provides a general overview of the history of computer technology and computer science as an intellectual field of inquiry. Focusing on the scientific, technological, political, cultural, and business contexts that formed modern computing, the class explores computers as objects, ideas, and embodiments of broader emerging digital society. From early modern efforts to calculate the natural world through World War II codebreaking to present-day Silicon Valley, this course examines the computer as a transformative object and contextualizes its origins and development."
1221,History,Nations and Nationalisms in South Asia,79391,9.0,"This course examines the role which nationalism has played in the formation and political development of the nations and states of South Asia. It, therefore, examines nationalist forces in anti-colonial struggles, in post-colonial state formation and in contemporary political developments.

1382,Institute for Politics and Strategy,Latin American Politics,84306,9.0,"The worlds most unequal region is an area of contrasts. Ethnically diverse, stable and tumultuous, young and old, urban and rural, learned and illiterate, prosperous and poor, independent yet dependent. The social and material disparities that have characterized the region since colonial times has been a permanent source of instability and the cause of numerous political and economic experiments. Social scientists have found much material in the region to study democratic innovations, revolutions, coups, civil wars, military dictatorships, impeachments, populism, clientelism, corruption, import substitution industrialization, neoliberalism, socialism, regime changes, social movements, welfare policies, regional integration, and diversified leadership. The overarching question to be explored in this course is what forces affect the emergence, development, collapse, reemergence, and consolidation of democracy. To understand the regions present, it is necessary to study path dependence. Thus, the course centers in three historical periods. First, we will briefly examine Latin American history from its conquest to the end of World War II (1492-1945). The aim is to uncover the demographic and geographical setting with its economic, social, and political evolution. The second part centers on the Cold War (1947-1991) and its combination of political and economic experiments. The third part covers the last forty years, including the wave of transitions to democracy to the current challenges to democratic consolidation. We will also address how Latin America has integrated to globalization and how the relationship with the US and China has experienced fundamental changes since the 1990s."

1386,Institute for Politics and Strategy,Implementing Public Policy:  From Good Idea To Reality,84336,12.0,"Good public policy doesnt just happen. Rather, successful policy is the result of thorough research, careful drafting, and successful navigation within the government or non-government organization whose leadership may ultimately promulgate it. The course begins with a brief review of government and organizational behavior in a bureaucracy, and the identification of a federal agencys current policy system as a framework to which we will turn throughout the term. Study then turns to an overview of legal research skills. Though usually the province of law students and attorneys, such skills will enable students to know when policy may be crafted from scratch -- or where, when, and how policy must conform to larger governing legal or regulatory structures. Students will then consider a particular sub-specie of public policy, administrative law, which addresses the special circumstance of regulatory agencies and the statutory regimes that create and govern them. The course culminates with students developing and staffing a notional policy, modeled on the federal agency policy system studied throughout the term. This course may benefit a range of audiences"

This course will go into depth to analyze both terrorism and insurgency and their various manifestations. The course will provide a historical overview of how terrorism and insurgency have evolved over time, while also focusing on groups, methods, ideologies and organizational structures. Is the terrorism conducted by Salafist groups like Al-Qaida and the Islamic State significantly different than that perpetrated by ethno-nationalist groups like the Provisional Irish Republican Army and Tamil Tigers? What are the best methods to counter-terrorism and how successful have states been- both historically and more recently- at combating the threat posed by terrorism and insurgency?"
1396,Institute for Politics and Strategy,"Social Media, Technology, and Conflict",84390,9.0,"This course will examine the role that social media and technology have had on conflict and governance over the past decade. Interconnectedness has expanded dramatically and continues to expand, not only within coastal cities but also between them and their hinterlands, from city to city, and between home populations and global networks, including diaspora populations. The Arab Spring uprisings were significantly influenced by the use of cell phones, social media, and text-messaging as organizing tools. But it is not only protesters that are harnessing the power of social media and emerging technologies- insurgent groups like the Islamic State have been able to use Twitter, YouTube, Telegram and other social media platforms to their advantage. Apps have been used to both recruit and fund raise for terrorist groups, while individuals living on the other side of the world are radicalized by virulent ideologies spread through the Internet. The proliferation of so-called fake news and the ubiquity of social media has introduced an entirely new variable into the study of conflict and relations between individuals, small groups, non-state actors, and nation-states."

1404,Institute for Politics and Strategy,Latin American Politics,84606,12.0,"The worlds most unequal region is an area of contrasts. Ethnically diverse, stable and tumultuous, young and old, urban and rural, learned and illiterate, prosperous and poor, independent yet dependent. The social and material disparities that have characterized the region since colonial times has been a permanent source of instability and the cause of numerous political and economic experiments. Social scientists have found much material in the region to study democratic innovations, revolutions, coups, civil wars, military dictatorships, impeachments, populism, clientelism, corruption, import substitution industrialization, neoliberalism, socialism, regime changes, social movements, welfare policies, regional integration, and diversified leadership. The overarching question to be explored in this course is what forces affect the emergence, development, collapse, reemergence, and consolidation of democracy. To understand the regions present, it is necessary to study path dependence. Thus, the course centers in three historical periods. First, we will briefly examine Latin American history from its conquest to the end of World War II (1492-1945). The aim is to uncover the demographic and geographical setting with its economic, social, and political evolution. The second part centers on the Cold War (1947-1991) and its combination of political and economic experiments. The third part covers the last forty years, including the wave of transitions to democracy to the current challenges to democratic consolidation. We will also address how Latin America has integrated to globalization and how the relationship with the US and China has experienced fundamental changes since the 1990s."

This is an interdisciplinary course that marries American, Diplomatic, and Global History with International Relations and Political Science. We will make some use of primary sources and data analysis. A good grasp of 20th century American and world history, and some familiarity with IR theory are not requirements but will prove helpful. By the end of the semester, students should have acquired a broad understanding of the most important foreign policy events of the last century and have the tools to analyze foreign policy decision-making."
1407,Institute for Politics and Strategy,Representation and Redisctricting,84652,12.0,"What does it mean to be represented? Who is represented, who isnt? What is the nature of that representation? In practice, does the norms of representation result in policy congruence? In this course, we will explore the concept of representation, what it means in theory, and how it works in practice. We will explore the theoretical underpinnings of representation from a democratic norms perspective, the legal and constitutional nature of U.S. institutions, and evaluate empirically how well represented the public is. In the United States, legislative elections are held in single-member districts, which require the drawing of district boundaries every decade. Several weeks of the course will be devoted to understanding this process. The course will culminate with a final project in which we will draw electoral maps that are legally compliant and will be proposed for the 2021 round of redistricting."

1454,Institute for Software Research,Data Intensive and Scalable Systems,17647,6.0,"Internet services companies such as Google, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook have pioneered systems that have achieved unprecedented scale while still providing high level availability and a high cost-performance. These systems differ from mainstream high performance systems in fundamental ways. They are data intensive rather than compute intensive as we see with mainstream super computers spending the bulk of their time performing data I/O and manipulation rather than computation. They need to inherently support scalability, typically having high reliability and availability demands as well. Given that they often operate in the commercial space the cost-performance of these systems needs to be such that the organizations dependent on such systems can turn a profit. Designing and building these systems require a specialized set of skills. This course will cover the set of topics needed in order to design and build data intensive scalable systems. In this domain engineers not only need to know how to architect systems that are inherently scalable, but to do so in a way that also supports high availability, reliability, and performance. Given the large distributed nature of these systems basic distributed systems concepts such as consistency and time and synchronization are also important. These systems largely operate around the clock, placing an emphasis on operational concerns. This course will introduce students to these concerns with the intent that they understand the extent to which things like deploying, monitoring, and upgrading impact the design. The course will be a hands-on project oriented course. The basic concepts will be given during the lectures and applied in the project.

1555,Language Technologies Institute,Designing Around Patents on Machine Learning and NLP Technology,11739,12.0,"This course uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing as vehicles to teach principles in designing software to avoid patents. After introducing students to the basics of patents, we investigate how to use students software skills to design around patents that is, create new technology that avoids a patent while maintaining some, or even all, of the performance and value of the patented technology. Designing around a patent can be viewed as a puzzle that requires technical skill, understanding the business value of technology, knowledge of patents, and creativity. Students will also be able to help design patents that cannot be easily designed-around. Not only does this add a valuable new dimension to the students skill set, the course material is organized as a vehicle for refining knowledge of ML and NLP techniques. We will practice by designing around patents on well-known ML and NLP algorithms. Students study the basic algorithm, learn the patents that cover those algorithms, and then experiment with software modifications that avoid the patent while preserving as much of the algorithms performance as possible. In essence, students will view the presence of particular patents as a design constraints, akin to designing for limited memory, bandwidth, or processor speed. Students must have already taken courses in Natural Language Processing (e.g., 11-411) and Machine Learning (e.g., 10-315).

Originally conceived as an inquiry into the growing problem of noise pollution in Vancouver, the Project expanded to encompass the wider study of the relationship between sonic environments and human communities, both historical and present. From a small group of sound researchers making field recordings in natural landscapes and urban areas has grown the modern study of Acoustic Ecology on a global scale, and also the creative practice of Soundscape Composition, in which recorded elements of sound environments are expressively explored through electronic music. Beginning with a history of the WSP, this course surveys aspects of the field of Acoustic Ecology as an aesthetic, political, and ethical phenomenon, with special attention to its relationship with the creative and sound practices of Soundwalking, Deep Listening, and Soundscape Composition. This course will also contextualize the WSP within a broader history of music and sound in the background, including Saties Furniture Music, Muzak, and coffee shop music. Throughout the course, students will participate in the activity and design of soundwalking, sonic field documentation / recording and sonic-environmental sampling, and the performance of background music.

It aims to dispel obscurity and mystery to make clear how consciousness can be illuminated empirically and theoretically without losing site of the phenomenal. We begin with isolating the basic phenomenon, delve into the conceptual and philosophical background dividing access from phenomenal consciousness, and discuss methods for tracking consciousness. We will then identify two clear questions about generic and specific consciousness. On generic consciousness, we shall explore a set of empirical theories of consciousness and the evidence that supports them. This will include recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory, and higher-order theory among others. On specific consciousness, we will look at neural correlates and experimental interventions to test causal claims about how consciousness arises from the brain, with specific emphasis on sensory consciousness and the role of information and representation. Special topics will likely include the attention in consciousness, consciousness and agency, vegetative state, unconscious sensory processing in normal and lesioned brains, split brain phenomena and abnormal consciousness in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. If possible, we will have a few guest lectures by local experts."

2281,Philosophy,Introduction to Philosophy,80100,9.0,"Even philosophers have a hard time explaining what exactly philosophy is. Instead of attempting a definition, one might instead list some of the questions philosophers try to answer. Like most other academic fields, philosophy has its own sub-disciplines, and each of these has its own questions it tries to answer. In this course, we will be looking at questions from several of these areas of philosophy, including"
2282,Philosophy,Introduction to Political Philosophy,80135,9.0,At the heart of political philosophy lie fundamental questions such as
2283,Philosophy,Nature of Reason,80150,9.0,"This course offers an intellectual history of philosophical views regarding the nature of human reasoning in mathematics and the sciences, from ancient to modern times. The first part of the course traces the search for deductive methods for obtaining certain knowledge, starting with Aristotle and Euclid, and continuing through the Middle Ages and late Renaissance thought, to the work of Boole and Frege in the nineteenth century. The second part of the course considers the history of skepticism about empirical knowledge, covering Plato, Sextus Empiricus, Descartes, Pascal, and Hume, along with replies to skepticism in the works of Bayes and Kant. The third part of the course discusses theories of the nature of mind, culminating in the computational conception of mind that underlies contemporary cognitive science."
2284,Philosophy,Nature of Language,80180,9.0,"Language is used to talk about the world or to describe it, but how do we go about describing language itself? Linguistics is the name given to the science of language, whose task it is to give such a description. The discipline of linguistics has developed novel tools for describing and analyzing language over the last two hundred years and in this course we learn what these tools are and practice applying them. Sub-areas of linguistics which we study include phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the study of sound systems), morphology (the study of parts of words), and syntax (the study of combinations of words). Beyond this, we look at changes in language over time, and we consider the puzzle of linguistic meaning. The methods of linguistics are useful in the study of particular languages and in the study of language generally, so this course is useful for students of foreign languages as well as those interested in going on to study language acquisition, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, philosophy of language, and computer modeling of language."
2285,Philosophy,Disagreeable Language: talk in the age of polarization,80184,9.0,"What do you do when confronted with opinions that (to you) are obviously wrong - supported by facts that are not even based in (your) reality? This is a situation we more and more find ourselves facing, or would if we ever ventured out of our own ideological bubble (which is constantly replenished by Big Tech and only with information pre-matched to our biases). It is held in place by human language itself - our supposed primary means of communication. While it is true that pictures can lie -- one hundred years ago Arthur Conan Doyle got taken in by the Cottingley pixie photographs, and now theres CGI and Deepfake -- language has always been the premier instrument for the conveyance of untruths. And when the facts themselves are up for grabs, the traditional approach -- going outside of language for confirmation and fact-checking - doesnt work either. Can anything be done about this precarious situation? Disagreeable Language explores a possible solution -- through linguistics, the study of human language. A sub-field of linguistics is the study of language structure, an enterprise which is self-contained and relies on no information outside of language and speaker intuitions. But this independence from reality may make linguistics the right tool for the detection of reality. If patterns of untruth leave their mark in language itself, linguistic techniques would be the way to reveal them. That could provide an escape route out of the matrix. At the very least, students in this course will learn basic methods for interrogating the language we use to get through to one another, that is, basic methods for doing linguistics."

2289,Philosophy,Philosophy of Social Science,80221,9.0,"This course will explore various philosophical issues germane to social science. The central question of the course asks whether we can use traditional scientific tools to understand social phenomena, e.g. wars and religions, in the same way that we use them to understand natural phenomena, e.g. gases, lasers and planetary orbits. Some of the more specific questions we address"

2293,Philosophy,Modern Philosophy,80251,9.0,"This class will focus on the history of Western philosophy in the modern period, with special emphasis on the early modern era of roughly 1600-1800. Massive upheavals and conflicts in science, politics, and religion fueled attempts to find new ways of making sense of the world, and we will try to situate our philosophers within this rapidly evolving intellectual context. In particular, we will examine the impact of these changes on two subfields of philosophy"

2295,Philosophy,Analytic Philosophy,80254,9.0,"This course examines the revolutionary impact of philosophy at the turn of the 20th century on contemporary thought and progress. By the 1920s some scientists and philosophers became hopeful that the end of the long tradition of philosophical deadlock was finally within reach. Buoyed in particular by Einsteins theory of relativity and the invention of modern logic, they created a new kind of philosophy with the goal of applying logical and empirical methods to philosophical problems. This new approach led to new puzzles and paradoxes, along with a focus on the age old question of what can be known and what is meaningful. The modern fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and information and computer sciences all owe a debt to these sources, as does of course contemporary philosophy. Our quest will be to understand both what authors like Frege, Russell, and the Vienna Circle were up to in the first place, and how their work contributed to the world we live in today."

2300,Philosophy,Mathematical Revolutions,80312,9.0,"Mathematics is a central part of our intellectual experience. It is connected to sophisticated philosophical perspectives, say, in the work of Plato, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, as well as in contemporary analytic philosophy; it is equally connected to fundamental views in the sciences, say, in the work of Ptolemy, Galileo, Newton, Einstein, as well as in contemporary cosmology. The common view that mathematics - if not directly static, is evolving in a linear fashion - does not withstand historical scrutiny. Indeed, there are many dramatic conceptual changes concerning the very nature and object of mathematics. We examine three episodes in the relatively recent past that reflect radical transformations of the subject. They are closely associated with three mathematicians in whose work those revolutionary changes come to the fore most poignantly. The three episodes are framed by a discussion, at the beginning, of the axiomatic method and, at the end, of contemporary computational models of mathematical thinking. The episodes fall within the period from 1854 to 1954, but have deep roots in the past. The first episode deals with the shift from geometry to arithmetic as the foundational discipline for mathematics. The accompanying change in the methodological perspective is expressed in Hilberts Foundations of Geometry, the center of the second episode. When joined with contemporaneous logical developments, that perspective underlies the formalization of mathematics. Gdels incompleteness theorems imposed theoretical limits on that work. However, given Turings analysis of computations, the question remains, how much of mathematical reasoning can be accomplished by computing machines. Completing a full circle, we incorporate central features of the axiomatic method into computational models of mathematical thinking."
2301,Philosophy,Logic and AI,80316,9.0,"In this course, we will study logical systems that are relevant to, and motivated by, research in artificial intelligence. We will see how key ideas and advances in logic have found (and continue to find) natural applications in AI. More generally, we will see how logic and AI can benefit, and historically have benefited, from each other. A central aim of this course is to understand how logical languages of varying expressive power can be put to use in AI as a tool for representation and reasoning. Some of the topics that we will be focusing on are (1) non-monotonic and default logics, (2) modal logics for reasoning about knowledge/belief, temporal structures, and computation, (3) probabilistic logics (and the relation between logic and probability), (4) logics of graphical causal models and counterfactuals, as well as (5) elements of probabilistic programming and computable probability theory."
2302,Philosophy,Epistemology of Machine Learning,80326,9.0,"Learning is hard Programming a computer is also hard. Better that computers learn on their own from data how best to serve us. That is the goal of machine learning (ML), which is arguably the most successful branch of artificial intelligence. The very idea raises some natural, fundamental questions. What, exactly, is the goal of learning? Is it maintenance of consistency among our beliefs (Bayesian statistics), or is it a matter of estimating or predicting quantities in nature (frequentist statistics)? Is the goal prediction or truth; control or understanding; actual fact or necessary causal relations? Are predictions expected to be reliable beyond the narrow circumstances of training? Can learning be guaranteed to succeed by a specified time? Does success entail some detectable mark or sign of success that can be used to terminate the learning procedure? What roles do causality and simplicity play in learning, and how? Those questions arise spontaneously for the reflective ML researcher, but they also cross over into the foundations of statistics, the philosophy of science, and epistemology, the traditional philosophical study of the nature of knowledge and justified belief. This class provides an introduction to the relevant philosophical/foundational issues underlying ML research. It involves both philosophical reflection and exercises providing concrete experience with ML methods. A unifying theme is that strong definitions of successful learning imply correspondingly strong limits on what can be learned."
2303,Philosophy,Ethical Theory,80330,9.0,"Every day, even in very subtle ways, we make judgments of value that shape our lives and our conduct. This course will examine four influential attempts at providing a systematic account of the source and nature of moral value, its relationship to other kinds of value, and the practical implications of different answers to these questions. This focus on the fundamental structure of moral value will frequently engage topics such as the nature of the good, subjectivist and objectivist accounts of value, forms of moral naturalism verses attempts at moral constructivism, and will draw on historical as well as more contemporary sources. Particular attention will be paid to articulating the specific sources of disagreement that distinguish competing moral theories in order to facilitate our ability to adjudicate between them on a reasoned basis."
2304,Philosophy,Phonetics and Phonology II,80382,9.0,"This course is a continuation of Phonetics and Phonology I (80-282), and is designed to expand upon the phonetic and phonological skills and knowledge developed in that course. Students will carry out a phonetic study (either acoustic or perceptual) designed by the instructor; the particular topic varies from semester to semester. As co-researchers, students will be involved in all aspects of data collection and analysis. Lessons in phonetics will be designed to train students on the necessary skills and concepts required, including understanding the articulatory, acoustic, and perceptual correlates of the phenomenon under investigation, as well as data analysis and interpretation of the results. A presentation session will be organized for the end of the semester. In tandem with the phonetic study, a related phonological phenomenon will be investigated throughout the semester. This phenomenon will be explored by using a set of case studies that can be investigated through various phonological and psycholinguistic perspectives. We will cover major developments in phonological theory, including SPE-style features, feature geometry/autosegmental phonology, and Optimality Theory. We will also consider these phenomena in light of more recent approaches to phonological representation, including Exemplar Theory and Articulatory Phonology. Assessment of phonetics will primarily come from the research project and in-class lab work, but will be supplemented with quizzes to ensure that core concepts are acquired. Assessment of phonology will primarily come from problem sets. Students will finish this course with a solid understanding of how to do phonetic research, and an appreciation of how various theoretical frameworks have attempted to account for phonological phenomena."

2311,Philosophy,Categorical Logic,80514,9.0,"This course focuses on applications of category theory in logic and computer science. A leading idea is functorial semantics, according to which a model of a logical theory is a set-valued functor on a category determined by the theory. This gives rise to a syntax-invariant notion of a theory and introduces many algebraic methods into logic, leading naturally to the universal and other general models that distinguish functorial from classical semantics. Such categorical models occur, for example, in denotational semantics. e.g. treating the lambda-calculus via the theory of cartesian closed categories. Higher-order logic is treated categorically by the theory of topoi. We shall see how this idea connects logic with topology (the models of a theory form a space). A prerequisite for this course is familiarity with basic category theory (as treated in the course 80-413/713)."
2312,Philosophy,Seminar on Formal Epistemology: Belief and Evidence,80521,9.0,"There has been a flurry of recent work on a variety of modal logics designed for reasoning about knowledge, belief, and evidence, in both static and dynamic contexts. What is the relationship between knowledge and belief? What is the role of evidence and justification? How do we react to new information, update our beliefs, and reason conditionally? These are old questions which modern logical frameworks promise to shed new light on. In this seminar we will read and analyze contemporary papers on these topics, both to gain an understanding of the current state-of-the-art, and to critically assess the extent to which these formal frameworks are genuinely enhancing our understanding of the underlying phenomena of interest."

Discussions are often moderated by the person whose work is being discussed. The course therefore provides an survey of a wide range of philosophical issues and methods and strives to situate more technically oriented work within a broader philosophical context by emphasizing links to traditional philosophical problems, methods, frameworks or assumptions.

It aims to dispel obscurity and mystery to make clear how consciousness can be illuminated empirically and theoretically without losing site of the phenomenal. We begin with isolating the basic phenomenon, delve into the conceptual and philosophical background dividing access from phenomenal consciousness, and discuss methods for tracking consciousness. We will then identify two clear questions about generic and specific consciousness. On generic consciousness, we shall explore a set of empirical theories of consciousness and the evidence that supports them. This will include recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory, and higher-order theory among others. On specific consciousness, we will look at neural correlates and experimental interventions to test causal claims about how consciousness arises from the brain, with specific emphasis on sensory consciousness and the role of information and representation. Special topics will likely include the attention in consciousness, consciousness and agency, vegetative state, unconscious sensory processing in normal and lesioned brains, split brain phenomena and abnormal consciousness in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. If possible, we will have a few guest lectures by local experts."

Is this likely to occur? How will emerging technologies reshape the U.S. labor market? How important is the gig economy, and how big might it become? What can policy makers do to ensure that the growth of the American economy is more inclusive and equitable? The curriculum of 90-745 has been rewritten to help Heinz students (and other interested CMU students) think seriously and rigorously about the future of work in the 21st century American economy. The course will place current concerns in the broader context of the major structural shifts in the U.S. labor market over the past several decades. Drawing upon the most recent quantitative analyses, the course will show that technological change has contributed to increasingly unequal outcomes in the U.S. labor market for decades, and that this trend is likely to continue as a new wave of technological change unfolds. The course will also consider the degree to which globalization, immigration, rising monopoly power, declining union strength, minimum wage laws, and discrimination based on race and gender have contributed to rising inequality in U.S. incomes. The course will draw upon frontier research to identify old and new policy ideas that could help make economic growth more inclusive, and it will bring into the classroom policy entrepreneurs who are making a real difference. The course instructor, Professor Lee Branstetter, is a globally recognized expert on the economics of innovation and technological change. He leads the Future of Work research initiative within Carnegie Mellons Block Center for Technology and Society.

This course is an experiment in improving public policy through by working outside the traditional structures of government. For Spring 2020, the Policy Innovation Lab will be investigating climate resiliency challenges with external partner agencies and organizations. Students will be investigating a number of problem spaces and building policy-driven prototypes driven by user research. Students will work to solve pressing challenges by redefining the problem in terms of understanding the affected users of systems, conducting user-centered research, designing solutions, testing those same solutions, and iteratively improving those outcomes. This course is designed to take advantage of recent lessons learned in applied innovation in government entities around the world. The actual outcomes will be heavily dependent on both the needs of the problem sets for each course as well as the skills of the students. The course will apply some methodologies commonplace in industry like agile, design-thinking, and open source to deliver products and services that have the potential to live on beyond the course. For public-facing projects, work will be done in a transparent manner where possible in order to encourage external participation. Students will be expected to embrace a culture that expects and encourages rapid iteration, express a willingness to fail early in order to discover a solution that ultimately works, and a flat structure that provides students with an opportunity to deliver for our government partners."

This micro-mini course serves as an introduction to global health security and its intricate links to international relations and international development. As societies and economies are increasingly interconnected and thus interdependent, new forms of health security threats are arising, and nations are investing more in mutual preparedness and are conducting new forms of soft power diplomacy to mitigate those risks. In recent years, the realm of health security has expanded greatly with more governments, companies, and NGOs working to address both nascent and persistent threats. Over an immersive weekend of overview and interaction, this micro-mini highlights prominent threat categories, namely the 3-D threats of Disaster, Disease, and Disorder, with complex humanitarian crises showcasing the latter threat. To illustrate factors at work, time will be devoted to deep dives using case studies and readings on prominent events. This seminar-style course will serve as an active policy laboratory in which your ideas are solicited and further shaped with the participation of the class cohort. Practical frameworks will be employed to simplify the dynamics within complex situations, and to organize your thinking about actions and options. An overnight diagramming activity assessing a humanitarian crisis between the first and second day activates analytical skills regarding causative determinants, strategic goals, and implementation of action plans.

Economic development is driven largely by funding and financing opportunities. Nearly every redevelopment, business expansion, community facility and infrastructure project hinges on the availability of affordable, patient and flexible capital. When addressing sustainability in economic development, funding and finance are even more critical. The lack of funding and finance can result in the ability for projects and programs to move forward in an effective manner. From the bedrock tools like bonds and targeted tool like tax increment to tax credit investment and access to capital lending programs, the development finance toolbox provides financing options that cover the entire development continuum. Unlocking the Development Finance Toolbox to Support Sustainable Economic Development will explore the intersection of development, sustainability and finance with an in depth review of the financing tools that catalyze and drive job growth and economic expansion. This course will not only explore the tools behind effective development but also examine success projects and programs that are driving communities towards a sustainable future."

This course is for students that want to learn how to take ideas that respond to societal needs and frame it within a sustainable business structure. Ideas may be for new social ventures or innovations within existing institutions and corporations. The students will work on an idea they have and take it through a model accelerator program curriculum. Accelerators are fixed-term cohort-based programs that include seed investment, mentorship, a curriculum that aims to fast forward business planning and strategy and culminate in what is typically called demo day - an opportunity for participating teams to present to potential investors. The course is open to students from different disciplines. This course will utilize online resources as well as readings culled from leading resources on lean business planning. It is an applied learning course and will require working practical knowledge of basic financial statements. At the end of the course, students will be able to take an idea through a model accelerator curriculum - from establishing a mission, vision, theories of change and impact pathways to market and competitive analysis, identifying target markets, customer acquisition, basic financial modeling to crafting the pitch deck. Students will be able to understand a basic structure to business modeling that they can use to form the basic guiding foundations to future new ventures - as startups or as innovations within corporations."

2510,Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt,Behavioral Economics in the Wild,90891,12.0,"Behavioral Economics is a sub-field of economics that, relying on insights from psychology and decision-making, aspires to describe actual behavior with greater empirical accuracy and psychological realism than that implied by the standard neoclassical model. In this course, we will investigate the success of this approach in explaining ostensible anomalies in the wild such as under-savings for retirement, over-consumption of unhealthy food, extreme aversion to losses among investors, workers, and home-owners, the over-confidence of corporate CEOs and NFL general managers, and the influence of emotions on domestic violence, stock market activity, and risk-taking. We will first document and review the underlying theory for three conceptual departures from the standard model -non-standard preferences (e.g., present-bias, reference dependence), non-standard beliefs (e.g., overconfidence, gamblers fallacy), and non-standard decision-making (e.g., heuristics, emotions, framing effects)-and then quickly move to assess the evidence for these claims in field settings. We will additionally explore how markets respond to behavioral biases, and discuss recent research in behavioral policy with an emphasis on policies aimed at increasing savings, improving food choice, and heightening program take-up and compliance. The course will be paper-centric and we will review a variety of popular empirical methods from field experiments to quasi-experimental approaches (e.g., estimation through regression-based panel analyses, difference-in-differences, and instrumental variables). Student evaluation will be based on performance on problem sets, an exam, as well as a short class presentation of an empirical paper of choice."

Why does Congress have such a hard time getting to agree on budget policy? Why is there such pork barrel spending and government waste in Washington? The answers to these questions, and others like them, require a detailed knowledge of the law and politics that lie behind the budget process, and the difficult policy choices that make up that process each year. This course proceeds simultaneously along two tracks. Track I will cover the law and procedures you need to understand how the federal budget is formulated and acted upon. This sounds dull, but it isnt For good reason, people call Congress the worlds greatest soap opera; and the budget process, while complex, is full of political warfare, the clashing of egos, and the constant pressure of voter demands. Those who know the law and procedures can gain an advantage over others in the struggle for dollars and the way they get spent. While in this phase of the course, you will be assigned mini-briefs"

2582,Robotics,Robotics Business,16730,12.0,"This course introduces and develops business concepts that will be useful to new and existing companies, while focusing on robotic technology exemplars. The concepts begin with how to identify a new idea to for a business that can be effectively started. Initial ideas often start as a grandiose plan to change the world and these plans are legitimately the fuel that drive new businesses forward. However, when a company starts (e.g., builds a prototype or writes a first line of code), what is the least product a company can produce that customers still want and need? This kernel -- extracted from the big plan-- is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP). Once an MVP business kernel is formulated, we will learn and study how to understand customer needs, how to market a new idea and how raise and manage money for a new business entity. These steps abridge information that can be found in an MBA curriculum, but engineers and scientists focused on the technical side will need this information to participate in the process of building companies. In parallel, we will investigate the marketplace through the stock market. The stock market is a powerful window into the world of business. In other words, when a new business is built it has to live inside the competitive environment of every other business. To understand this eco-system, we will follow several companies in-situ as they go through their own ups-and-downs within the business world. The course is project based. Each student will either build their own business concept, or they will build an improvement plan that would be targeted to improve an existing business. Professor Bourne is a founding member of the Robotics Institute(1979) and has taught business concepts within the Tepper Business School and the Robotics Institute since 1988. In addition, he is the President of his own company Design One Software."

2595,Robotics,Special Topics: Provably Safe Robotics:,16883,12.0,"Safe autonomy has become increasingly critical in many application domains. It is important to ensure not only the safety of the ego robot, but also the safety of other agents (humans or robots) that directly interact with the autonomy. For example, robots should be safe to human workers in human-robot collaborative assembly; autonomous vehicles should be safe to other road participants. For complex autonomous systems with many degrees of freedom, safe operation depends on the correct functioning of all system components, i.e., accurate perception, optimal decision making, and safe control. This course deals with both the design and the verification of safe robotic systems. From the design perspective, we will talk about how to assure safety through planning, prediction, learning, and control. From the verification perspective, we will talk about verification of deep neural networks, safety or reachability analysis for closed loop systems, and analysis of multi-agent systems."

2608,Social & Decision Sciences,Decision Analysis,88223,12.0,"This course offers practical guidance about how to make better decisions and teaches students how to use modeling to do decision analysis. We analyze decisions involving uncertainty, risk, and time delay. In addition to methods of decision analysis, the course will also emphasize sensitivity analysis and communication of recommendations."
2609,Social & Decision Sciences,Causal Inference in the Field,88252,9.0,"Causal questions are pervasive in the social and behavioral sciences, and empirical researchers often use regression analysis as a tool for tackling such questions. This course focuses on the scientific problem of analyzing causal hypotheses in real-world settings, not on the mathematical details of regression. After clearly distinguishing prediction from causation, we discuss how to represent causal hypotheses and how to use regressions to analyze both predictive and causal hypotheses. Using in-class data exercises throughout, we will examine how to move from an interesting but somewhat vague question about the world (e.g., do police discriminate based on race and gender, do NFL athletes choke under high pressure, does parenthood improve happiness) to a clear statistical model that, when estimated, meaningfully addresses the question asked. The course emphasizes causal analysis as the main research goal and multivariate linear regression as the main statistical tool. After mastering basic techniques, we will introduce students to more advanced econometric approaches such as panel regressions and instrumental variables to deal with trickier settings in which causal inference is more challenging (e.g., do more guns lead to more violence?). In keeping with the hands-on philosophy of the course, a central focus of the semester will be a group research paper/presentation where students will have the opportunity to formulate and empirically test a research question of their choosing. Students will learn how to find, clean, and analyze a new dataset, and then concisely communicate their findings in the form of a scientific paper (and accompanying presentation). The research project makes this course excellent preparation for any student who hopes to ultimately write an undergraduate thesis."
2610,Social & Decision Sciences,Topics of Law: The Bill of Rights,88284,9.0,"This course examines the history and place of the Bill of Rights in our nations constitutional framework. It focuses on the historical origins of the U.S. Constitution, of each of the first ten amendments to the Constitution (that we refer to as the Bill of Rights), how the meanings and interpretations of these have evolved over time, and what they mean to us today. Each article of the Bill of Rights will be examined in terms of its original intentions, and then through cases that have challenged and been interpreted through the Bills articles."
2611,Social & Decision Sciences,Programming and Data Analysis for Social Scientists,88300,9.0,"This course provides a first introduction to the statistical programming language R, and is designed primarily with social science majors in mind.

We welcome students who will be coding for the first time"
2612,Social & Decision Sciences,Behavioral Decision Making,88302,9.0,"Behavioral decision making is the study of how people make decisions, in terms that can eventually help them to make better decisions. It draws together research from psychology, economics, political science, and management, among other fields. It has applications that range from managing potentially hazardous technologies, to involving patients more fully in the choice of medical procedures, to the design of computer-interactive systems. The course covers behavioral theories of probabilistic inference, intuitive prediction, preference, and decision making. Topics include heuristics and biases in inference and prediction, risk perceptions and attitudes, strategies for combining information from different sources and dealing with conflicting objectives, and the roles of group and emotional processes in decision making. The course emphasizes the mutually reinforcing relationship between theory and application."
2613,Social & Decision Sciences,Team Dynamics and Leadership,88341,9.0,"Much of the work in groups and organizations consists of communication. You communicate to get information that will be the basis of decisions, to provide a vision for the people who work for and with you, to coordinate activity, and to sell yourself and your work. The goal of this course is to identify sources of communication problems within an organization and ways to overcome them. To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong. The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations. This course is not a practicum in public speaking or writing, although you will get some experience writing, speaking and managing impressions. Rather the intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly do when you return to work. Readings come from both the research and the managerial literatures. Among the topics considered are managerial communication, persuasion and conformity, self presentation and person perception, social networks. Cases and group projects give you an opportunity to apply what youve learned."
2614,Social & Decision Sciences,Behavioral Economics of Poverty and Development,88366,9.0,"This course will introduce students to the study of economic development and poverty alleviation, with a special focus on recent insights from the intersection of psychology and economics. We will primarily focus on the health, microfinance, agriculture, and education sectors in developing countries. The course will have a methodological component largely centered on using experiments to evaluate interventions and policies that apply to households, small firms, and farms. While we will cover standard economic approaches, we will give extra attention to how a behavioral lens can help in both understanding development issues (e.g. barriers to household risk management) and in designing effective interventions (e.g. the timing of fertilizer sales)."
2615,Social & Decision Sciences,Behavioral Economics in the Wild,88367,9.0,"Behavioral Economics is a sub-field of economics that, relying on insights from psychology and decision-making, aspires to describe actual behavior with greater empirical accuracy and psychological realism than that implied by the standard neoclassical model. In this course, we will investigate the success of this approach in explaining ostensible anomalies in the wild such as under-savings for retirement, over-consumption of unhealthy food, extreme aversion to losses among investors, workers, and home-owners, the over-confidence of corporate CEOs and NFL general managers, and the influence of emotions on domestic violence, stock market activity, and risk-taking. We will first document and review the underlying theory for three conceptual departures from the standard model -non-standard preferences (e.g., present-bias, reference dependence), non-standard beliefs (e.g., overconfidence, gamblers fallacy), and non-standard decision-making (e.g., heuristics, emotions, framing effects)-and then quickly move to assess the evidence for these claims in field settings. We will additionally explore how markets respond to behavioral biases, and discuss recent research in behavioral policy with an emphasis on policies aimed at increasing savings, improving food choice, and heightening program take-up and compliance. The course will be paper-centric and we will review a variety of popular empirical methods from field experiments to quasi-experimental approaches (e.g., estimation through regression-based panel analyses, difference-in-differences, and instrumental variables). Student evaluation will be based on performance on problem sets, an exam, as well as a short class presentation of an empirical paper of choice."

It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic models in scientific investigation. Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation into frequency-based components. In the visual system, V1 simple cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized using dynamic place models. It has also been proposed that perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian) combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers. Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function. This course will examine some of the most important methods and claims that have come from applying statistical thinking"

VCPE transactions are usually, risky, complex, and highly customized for the particulars of the situation. The transaction is far from simple. The complexity of VCPE deals requires the specialized financial intermediaries of Venture Capital and Private Equity funds. VCPE intermediaries invest in companies. A VC funds investment in an entrepreneurial start-up is an example. And they also have investors into their fund (typically sophisticated investors like pension funds, endowments). It turns out that both sides of this investment are complicated."
2745,Tepper School of Business,International Finance:,45825,6.0,"This course will cover issues related to both international financial markets and the financial operations of a firm within the international environment. Topics will include the structure and functioning of the international currency and money markets; identification, measurement, and management of the impact of exchange rate changes on the firm; financing choices in a global market and international investments. While the course discusses theoretical basis on these various issues, it also mixes in empirical evidence and discussion of firms and investors actual behaviors. The course is ideally suited for those pursuing careers in corporations with operations abroad or careers in the investment banks or consulting firms that advise these corporations.(EO 11-14)"
2746,Tepper School of Business,Real Estate:,45826,6.0,"Real Estate The aim of this course is to introduce students to many of the a) institutional arrangements associated with real estate transactions and b) provide a framework for understanding valuation and transactions in these markets. Among the topics we plan to cover are the role of various types of market participants including landlords, tenants, institutional investors and brokers (search). Many of the incentive (agency) conflicts that arise in these relationships will be considered. From a valuation perspective we will highlight the role of market efficiency compared to financial markets, basic valuation methods, the role of appraisals, eminent domain, synergies between property types (parking, anchor stores, etc.) and the irreversible nature of decisions and real options. The role of taxes, such as Section 1031 tax-free exchanges and depreciation, in generating transactions will be considered. In the final portion of the course we anticipate addressing the role of leverage and mortgage finance in structuring real estate transactions and the contribution of mortgage finance to the financial crisis."
2747,Tepper School of Business,Marketing Research:,45830,6.0,"This course is aimed at the manager who is the ultimate user of marketing research and the one responsible for determining the scope and direction of research activities. The techniques of research design, data collection and data analysis occupy an important role in the work of a marketing manager. The course focuses on helping managers recognize the role of systematic information gathering and analysis in making marketing decisions. The aim is to develop an appreciation for the potential contributions and limitations of marketing research. While the emphasis of the course will be on the interpretation and application of the results for use in making real life marketing decisions, a substantial amount of time will also be devoted to understanding and using the key methodologies underlying modern marketing research. Students will get hands-on analytical experience by using the software package SPSS. Marketing research is simply an organized way of developing and providing information for decision-making purposes. The quality of the information, for example its validity and reliability, depends on the care exercised in executing the various steps of the marketing research process. The steps include problem definition, research design (exploratory, descriptive and causal), data collection methods, questionnaire design and attitude measurement, sampling schemes, and data analysis. Emphasis will be given to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of marketing research and how they help managers in addressing substantive marketing problems such as"

In this course, we will explore the most recent scientific research in marketing, psychology, and behavioral economics on judgment and decision making. We will develop your ability to understand and influence what people want, how people decide what and when to buy, and whether people will be satisfied or dissatisfied with their decisions. These psychological insights are particularly useful for marketing strategy, brand positioning, and marketing communication decisions, but also yield insight into common biases in judgment and decision making, beyond marketing, to which you would otherwise fall prey. Why people are willing to drive across town to save 5 on a tank of gasoline, for example, when they would not drive a minute to save 5 on a refrigerator. We will discuss some of these applications in class. In addition, we will examine the methodology of market research (specific to consumer behavior) to build the tools you will need to interpret and base decisions on it. Readings will include primary empirical research articles (e.g., Journal of Consumer Research articles), business journal articles, and research reviews (e.g., Harvard Business Review articles). The course includes lecture, discussion, an exam, and a team term project."

The recent explosion in large-scale high-resolution data enables managers to ask and answer questions regarding businesses and consumers at a whole new level. Managers are faced with data about businesses and consumers that are growing faster than they can be utilized. Data mining enables business to extract useful consumer behavior and preferences from seemingly tremendous and unorganized data, which then can be utilized for data-driven decision-making and competitive advantage. Applications can be found in e-commerce, sales, marketing, finance, operations, etc."
2757,Tepper School of Business,Supply Chain Management:,45862,6.0,"A supply chain is a network of facilities and distribution options that performs the functions of procurement of materials, transformation of these materials into intermediate and finished products, and the distribution of these finished products to customers (Ganeshan and Harrison, 1995). However, facilities are not necessarily connected in a serial fashion, despite its name. Therefore, a supply chain really describes a network of interconnected value-add transformations. Supply chain management (SCM) is the coordination of production, inventory, location, and transportation among the participants in a supply chain to achieve the best mix of responsiveness and efficiency for the market being served (Hugos, 2011). SCM includes the strategic design of this network, the tactical planning of supply, production, inventory, transportation, and distribution as well as the operational control of the flows of materials, information, money and physical goods. Traditionally, the goal of SCM has been to maximize profitability or minimize cost. Typically, this is achieved by matching supply and demand. Increasingly, the concept of risk, arising from uncertainty, disruptions, and need for rapid reaction, have also brought on the need to incorporate agility and responsiveness in the mix of goals. This course explores how firms can make better SCM decisions, focusing mostly on tactical challenges, but also touching on some strategic and operational topics. Throughout, this course illustrates qualitative as well as quantitative principles and business analytics applied to real SCM challenges the tools of SCM with an emphasis on approaches to increase responsiveness to manage risk."
2758,Tepper School of Business,Operations Strategy,45864,6.0,"The goal of this course is to provide conceptual frameworks and analytical tools to optimize key decisions in formulating operations strategy and in managing operational processes. The intended audience for this course is those who seek better understanding of the connection between operations and strategy, including an operations manager, a general manager (who interface with operations), a consultant, and an entrepreneur. Operations strategy involves configuring and developing resources processes used to design, produce, distribute, and deliver goods and/or services. Operations strategy differs from corporate/business strategy in that it is less about industries and choosing a competitive position, but more about enabling the execution of corporate/business strategy (i.e., how to best deliver the value proposition). Obviously, operations strategy must build on good understanding of day-to-day operations management. Thus, this course will involve both quantitative analysis of firms operations processes and qualitative assessment of firms operations strategies. Specifically, the course will consist of the following four parts"

We will examine how technology products differ from non-technology-based products and how the unique attributes of high-technology products influence the marketing strategies and tactics of those products. We will cover issues such as the diffusion of high technology products and crossing the chasm; pricing of technology products including versioning and bundling; compatibility; standardization within product markets; competition in technology-focused product arenas; continuous versus discontinuous product changes and the product line. Examples of technology-intensive industries are computer hardware and software, media and entertainment, telecommunications and e-commerce.

2761,Tepper School of Business,Competitive Strategy,45873,6.0,"This course in strategy provides advanced training in strategy based some of the newer developments in the field. It is designed to provide training for those going into consulting, investment banking, entrepreneurial startups, and corporate development. Competitive strategy in todays advanced economy reflects a mix of traditional strategies, designed to sustain advantage through physical assets and economies of scale, as well as newer strategies designed to gain advantage through information assets and network effects. The approach used to account for these increasing market dynamics is sustainability analysis, a method that formulates product strategies according to their expected profit half-life. We begin by looking at the different ways a corporation can be structured to give it an advantage. These include degrees of vertical integration, ranging from fully integrated (complete ownership of all the stages of value added), to virtually integrated (where the various stages of the company are linked electronically without ownership). We also look at advantages to be had through horizontal integration (core competencies), where components of value from different products are shared to yield sideways economies of scale. We then look at traditional big business strategy, where economies of scale dominate along with continuous, controlled innovation; a process referred to as scale orchestration. These standard cycle examples include Toyota, Federal Express, McDonalds, Toyota, Starbucks, and Las Vegas Casinos. We next look at Schumpeterian markets, where rapid wealth creation is followed by the gale of creative destruction, which yields advantage that must be renewed rapidly. Here, managers must obsolete their own products at a faster rate than competitors. These fast cycle examples include Intel, the golfing industry, Samsung smart phones and Zara."

Part of the course will be spent deconstructing existing contracts (term sheets to acquisition agreements to licensing agreements to franchise agreements) so that an appreciation can be gained for the accepted meaning of standard clauses and paragraphs and whether certain topics should be included or not regardless of the contracts subject matter. In addition to standard contracting issues and regulations, a deconstruction of employment contracts will occur so that students will understand why their employment contracts contain certain topics and clauses and what their meaning is."

Representing your company in external forums is a major executive responsibility but many executives do it poorly. When they speak to external audiences and sometimes to their own employees, executives frequently alienate their listeners.

This course covers the critical aspects of this relationship. It begins with some history and institutional description. When did the financialization of the energy industry begin? Why? What exactly does this mean? Has it been an unambiguously good thing, or has it led to some unanticipated side effects (e.g., bubbles) that prompt introspection? The course goes on to explore what makes energy finance distinct from other areas of corporate finance. Examples include distinctive financing structures such as project finance and tax-based equity vehicles, the ubiquitous role played by government regulation and tax policy, forms of business organization known as Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs), energy accounting and valuation, and a variety of financial modeling issues that are often referred to as real option models. The course will not be overly technical. It will be more of a broad overview than an in-depth technical analysis of a particular topic.
